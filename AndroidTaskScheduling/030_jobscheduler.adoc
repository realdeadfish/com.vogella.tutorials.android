== Using the JobScheduler to schedule background jobs_

=== The job scheduler API_
(((JobScheduler)))


The Android 5.0 Lollipop (API 21) release introduces a job scheduler API via the `JobScheduler` class.
This API allows to batch jobs when the device has more resources available. 
In general this API can be used to schedule everything that is not time critical for the user.

=== Advantages of the job scheduler API

Compared to a custom SyncAdapter or the alarm manager, the JobScheduler supports batch scheduling of jobs.
The Android system can combine jobs so that battery consuption is reduced. 
JobManager makes handling uploads easier as it handles automatically also the case that the network is unreliable and survives application restarts.
Here are example when you would use this job scheduler:

* Tasks that should be done once the device is connect to a power supply
* Tasks that require network access or a Wi-Fi connection.
* Task that are not critical or user facing
* Tasks that should be running on a regular basis as batch where the timing is not critical

=== Create a Job

A unit of work is encapsulated by a `JobInfo` object. 
This object specifies the scheduling criteria.
The job scheduler is aware if the device is in idle model and if network activity is at the moment possible.
Use the `JobInfo.Builder` class to configure how the scheduled task should run. 
You can schedule the task to run under specific conditions, such as:

* Device is charging
* Device is connected to an unmetered network
* Device is idle
* Start before a certain deadline
* Start within a predefined time window, e.g., within the next hour
* Start after a minimal delay, e.g., wait a minimum of 10 minutes

These constraints can be combined. 
For example, you can schedule a job every 20 minutes, whenever the device is connected to an unmetered network.
Deadline is a hard constraint, if that expires the job is always scheduled.

To implement a Job, extend the `JobService` class and implement the `onStartJob` and `onStopJob`. 
If the job fails for some reason, return true from on the `onStopJob` to restart the job. 
The `onStartJob` is performed in the main thread, if you start asynchronous processing in this method, return true otherwise false.
