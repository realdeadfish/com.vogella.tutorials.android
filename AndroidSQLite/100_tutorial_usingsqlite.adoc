== Tutorial: Using SQLite

=== Introduction to the project

The following demonstrates how to work with an SQLite
database.
We will use a data access object (DAO) to manage the data
for us. The
DAO is responsible for handling the database connection and
for
accessing and modifying the data. It will also convert the
database
objects into real Java Objects, so that our user interface
code does
not
have to deal with the persistence layer.

The resulting application will look like the following.

Using a DAO is not always the right approach. A DAO
creates
Java model
objects; using a database directly or via a
`ContentProvider`
is typically more resource efficient as you can avoid the creation of
model objects.

I still demonstrate the usage of the DAO in this example to have a
relatively
simple
example to begin with. Use the latest version of
Android 4.0. This is currently API Level 15. Otherwise I would have
to
introduce the
`Loader`
class, which should be used as of Android 3.0 for managing a database
`Cursor`
. And this class
introduces additional
complexity.

=== Create Project

Create the new Android project with the name
`de.vogella.android.sqlite.first`
and an
_activity_
called
_TestDatabaseActivity_.

=== Database and Data Model

Create the
`MySQLiteHelper`
class. This class is responsible for creating the database. The
`onUpgrade()`
method will simply delete all existing data and re-create the
table.
It also defines several constants for the table name and
the table
columns.

include::res/simpledb/MySQLiteHelper.java[]
----

Create the
`Comment`
class. This class is our model and contains the data we will save in
the database and show in the user interface.

[source,java]
----
include::res/simpledb/Comment.java[]
----

Create the
`CommentsDataSource`
class. This class is our DAO. It maintains the database connection
and
supports
adding new comments and fetching all comments.

[source,java]
----
include::res/simpledb/CommentsDataSource.java[]
----

=== User Interface

Change your _main.xml_ layout file  in the <filename class="directory">res/layout_ folder to the
following. This layout has two buttons for adding and deleting
comments
and a
`ListView`
which will be used to display the existing comments. The comment
text
will be generated later in the
_activity_
by a small random generator.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/simpledb/main.xml[]
----

Change your
`TestDatabaseActivity`
class.
to the following. We use here a ListActivity for displaying the
data.

[source,java]
----
include::res/simpledb/TestDatabaseActivity.java[]
----

=== Running the apps

Install your application and use the _Add_ and _Delete_ button.
Restart your application to validate that the data is still there.
