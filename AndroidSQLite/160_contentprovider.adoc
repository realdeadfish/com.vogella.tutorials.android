== Content provider and sharing data

=== What is a content provider?

If you want
to
share data with other applications you can use a
_content provider_
(short provider). Provider offer data encapsulation based on URI's.
Any URI which starts with
`content://`
points to a resources which can be accessed via a provider. A URI for
a resource may allow to perform the basic CRUD operations (Create,
Read, Update, Delete) on the resource via the content provider.

A
provider
allows applications to access data. The data can be
stored in an SQlite database, on the file system, in flat files or on
a remote server.

While a
content provider
can be used within an application to
access data, its is typically
used to share data with other
application. As application data is by
default private, a
content
provider
is a convenient to share you data with other application
based on a
structured interface.

A content provider
must be declared in the manifest file for the
application.

=== Base URI of the content provider

The base URI to access a content provider is defined via the
combination of the
`content://`
schema and the name space of the provider. This name space is defined

in the
manifest
file
via the
`android:authorities`
attribute of the receiver registration. This can for example be:
`content://test/`

The base URI represents a
collection of resources. If the base
URI is
combined with an instance
identifier, e,g.,
`content://test/2`
, it represents a single instance.

=== Accessing a content provider

As it is required to know the URIs of a
provider
to access it,
it
is good practice to provide public constants for the
URIs to
document
them to other developers.

Many Android data sources, e.g. the contacts, are accessible
via
content providers.

=== Custom content provider

To create your custom content provider
you have to define a class
which extends
`android.content.ContentProvider`
. You must declare this class as content provider in
the Android
manifest file.
The corresponding entry
must specify the
`android:authorities`
attribute which allows identifying
the content provider. This
authority
is
the basis for
the URI to access
data and
must be
unique.

Your content provider must implement several methods, e.g.
`query()`
,
`insert()`
,
`update()`
,
`delete()`
,
`getType()`
and
`onCreate()`
. In case you do not support certain methods its good practice to
throw an
`UnsupportedOperationException()`
.

The
query() method must return a Cursor object.

=== Security and content provider

Until Android version 4.2 a
content provider
is by default
available to other Android applications. As of
Android
4.2 a
content
provider
must be explicitly exported.

To set the visibility of your
content provider
use the
`android:exported=false|true`
parameter
in the declaration of your
content provider
in the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.

TIP: It is good practice to always set the `android:exported` parameter to ensure correct behavior across Android versions.

=== Thread Safety

If you work directly with databases and have multiple writers
from different threads you may run into concurrency issues.

A content provider
can be accessed from several programs at the same
time,
therefore you
must implement the access thread-safe. The easiest
way is to use the
keyword
`synchronized`
in front of all methods of the provider,
so that only one thread can
access these
methods at the same time.

If you do not require that Android synchronizes data access to the
provider,
set the
`android:multiprocess=true`
attribute in your <provider>
definition in the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.
This permits an instance
of the provider to be created in
each
client
process, eliminating the
need to perform interprocess
communication (IPC).
