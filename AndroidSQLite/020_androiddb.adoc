== SQLite architecture

=== Packages

The
`android.database`
package
contains all necessary classes for working with databases.
The
`android.database.sqlite`
package
contains the SQLite specific classes.

=== Creating and updating database with SQLiteOpenHelper

To create and upgrade a database in your Android application you
create a
subclass of the
`SQLiteOpenHelper`
class.
In the constructor of your subclass you
call the
`super()`
method of
`SQLiteOpenHelper`
,
specifying the database name and the current database version.

In this class you need to
override the following methods to create and
update your database.

* `onCreate()` - is called by the framework, if the database is accessed but not yet created.
* `onUpgrade()` - called, if the database version is increased in your application code. 
This method allows you to update an existing database schema or to drop the existing database and recreate it via the `onCreate()` method.

Both methods receive an
`SQLiteDatabase`
object as parameter which is the Java representation of the
database.

The
`SQLiteOpenHelper`
class
provides the
`getReadableDatabase()`
and
`getWriteableDatabase()`
methods
to get access to an
`SQLiteDatabase`
object; either in read
or
write mode.

The database tables should use the
identifier
`_id`
for the primary key of the table.
Several Android functions rely on
this standard.

TIP: It is good practice to create a separate class per table. This class
defines
static
`onCreate()`
and
`onUpgrade()`
methods. These methods are called in the corresponding methods
of
`SQLiteOpenHelper`
. This way your implementation of
`SQLiteOpenHelper`
stays readable, even if you have several tables.

=== SQLiteDatabase

`SQLiteDatabase`
is the base class for working with a
SQLite
database in Android and
provides methods to open, query, update and
close the database.

More specifically
`SQLiteDatabase`
provides the
`insert()`
,
`update()`
and
`delete()`
methods.

In addition it provides the
`execSQL()`
method, which allows to
execute an SQL statement directly.

The object
`ContentValues`
allows to define key/values. The
`key`
represents the table column
identifier
and the
`value`
represents the
content for the table
record
in this column.
`ContentValues`
can be used for inserts and
updates of database entries.

Queries can be created via the
`rawQuery()`
and
`query()`
methods
or via the
`SQLiteQueryBuilder`
class
.

`rawQuery()`
directly
accepts an SQL select statement as input.

`query()`
provides a structured interface for specifying
the SQL query.

`SQLiteQueryBuilder`
is a convenience class that helps to build SQL queries.

=== rawQuery() Example

The following gives an example of a
`rawQuery()`
call.

[source,txt]
----
include::res/intro/rawquery.txt[]
----

=== query() Example

The following gives an example of a
`query()`
call.

[source,txt]
----
include::res/intro/query.txt[]
----

The method
`query()`
has the following parameters.

.Parameters of the query() method
|===
|Parameter |Comment

|String dbName
|The table name to compile the query against.

|String[] columnNames
|A list of which table columns to return. Passing "null" will return all columns.

|String whereClause
|Where-clause, i.e. filter for the selection of data, null will select all data.

|String[] selectionArgs
|You may include ?s in the "whereClause"". 
These placeholders will get replaced by the values from the selectionArgs array.

|String[] groupBy
|A filter declaring how to group rows, null will cause the
rows to not be grouped.

|String[] having
|Filter for the groups, null means no filter.

|String[] orderBy
|Table columns which will be used to order the data, null
means no
ordering.
|===

If a condition is not required you can pass
`null`
, e.g. for the group by
clause.

The
"whereClause"
is specified without the word
"where", for
example a "where" statement might look like:
"_id=19 and summary=?".

If you specify placeholder values in the where clause via
`?`
,
you pass
them as the
selectionArgs parameter to the query.

=== Cursor

A
query
returns a
`Cursor`
object. A Cursor represents the result of a query and basically
points
to one row of the query result. This way Android can buffer the
query results efficiently; as it does not have to load all data into
memory.

To get the number of
elements of the resulting query use the
`getCount()`
method.

To move between individual data
rows, you can use the
`moveToFirst()`
and
`moveToNext()`
methods. The

`isAfterLast()`
method allows to check if the end of the query result has been
reached.

`Cursor`
provides typed
`get*()`
methods, e.g.
`getLong(columnIndex)`
,
`getString(columnIndex)`
to access the column data for the current position of the result.
The
"columnIndex" is the number of the column you are
accessing.

`Cursor`
also provides the
`getColumnIndexOrThrow(String)`
method which allows to get the column index for a column name of the
table.

A
`Cursor`
needs to be closed with the
`close()`
method call.

=== ListViews, ListActivities and SimpleCursorAdapter

`ListViews`
are
`Views`
which allow to display a list of elements.

`ListActivities`
are specialized
_activities_
which make the usage of
`ListViews`
easier.

To work with databases and
`ListViews`
you can use the
`SimpleCursorAdapter`
. The
`SimpleCursorAdapter`
allows to set a layout for each row of the
`ListViews`
.

You also define an array which contains the column names and another
array which contains the IDs of
`Views`
which should be filled with the data.

The
`SimpleCursorAdapter`
class will map the columns to the
`Views`
based on the
`Cursor`
passed to it.

To obtain the
`Cursor`
you should use the
`Loader`
class.
