== Cursors and Loaders

One of the challenges with accessing databases is that this
access is slow. The other challenge is that the application needs to
consider the life cycle of the components correctly, e.g. opening and
closing the cursor if a configuration change happens.
	
To manage the life cycle you could use
the
`managedQuery()`
method in
_activities_
prior to Android 3.0.
	
As of Android 3.0 this method is
deprecated and you should use the
`Loader`
framework to access the
`ContentProvider`.
	
The
`SimpleCursorAdapter`
class, which can be used with
`ListViews`
,
has the
`swapCursor()`
method. Your
_Loader_
can use this method to update the
`Cursor`
in its
`onLoadFinished()`
method.
	
The
`CursorLoader`
class
reconnect
the
`Cursor`
after a configuration change.
