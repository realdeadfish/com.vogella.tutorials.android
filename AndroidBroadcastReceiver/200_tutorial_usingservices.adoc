== Exercise: System services and receiver

=== Target
		
In this chapter we will schedule a receiver
via the Android alert
manager
system service. Once called, it uses the Android vibrator
manager
and a
popup message (Toast) to
notify the user.
		
=== Implement project
		
Create a new project called
_de.vogella.android.alarm_
with the
activity called
_AlarmActivity_
.
		
Create the following layout.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/service/main.xml[]
----		
		
Create the following broadcast receiver class. This class will
get the vibrator service.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/service/MyBroadcastReceiver.java[]
----		
		
Register this class as a broadcast receiver in
_AndroidManifest.xml_
and request authorization to vibrate the phone.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/service/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----		
		
Change the code of your
`AlarmActivity`
class to the
following. This activity creates an
intent to start the
receiver and register this intent with the alarm manager service.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/service/AlarmActivity.java[]
----
		
=== Validate implementation
		
Run your application on the device. Set your time and start the
alarm. After the defined number of seconds a _Toast_ should be
displayed. Keep in mind that the vibration alarm does not work on the
Android emulator.
