== Defining custom events and receivers

=== Registering broadcast receiver for custom events
		
You can register a
receiver
for your custom actions.
		
The following
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file demonstrates a broadcast receiver which is registered for a
custom action.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/own/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----
	
=== Sending broadcast intents
		
The
`sendBroadcast()`
method from the
`Context`
class allows you to send
intents
to your registered receivers. The following coding show an example.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/own/trigger.java[]
----		

You cannot trigger system broadcasts events.
The Android system
will
prevent
this.
		
TIP: The receivers are called asynchronous, i.e., the `sendBroadcast()` method return immediately and does not wait until the receivers have executed.

=== Local broadcast events with LocalBroadcastManager

The
`LocalBroadcastManager`
class is used to register for and send broadcasts of Intents to local
objects within your process. This is faster and more secure as your
events don't leave your application.
		
The following example shows an activity
which registers for a customer event called
_my-event_
.
		
[source,java]

include::res/localbroadcastreceiver/Register.java[]

[source,java]
