== Using Robolectric for your test with Gradle

To use Robolectric for your Android unit tests, simply add the following dependency to your Gradle build file.

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    ...
    // Robolectric
    testCompile "org.robolectric:robolectric:3.0"
}
----

Your tests should be stored in the _src/test_ directory.
The class containing your Robolectric test must be annotate with the _@RunWith(RobolectricGradleTestRunner.class)_ test runner.
It must also use the `@Config()` to point to your `BuildConfig.class` class. 
The following shows an example test configured to run via Robolectric on the JVM.

[source,gradle]
----
include::res/install/DeckardActivityTest.java[]
----

[NOTE]
====
Instead of specifying the values via the `@Config` annotation, you could also use a _resources/robolectric.properties_ file. See
See http://robolectric.org/configuring for more information.
