== What is Robolectric

_Robolectric_ is designed to allow you to test Android applications on the JVM based on the _JUnit 4_ framework.
Robolectric is a framework that allows you to write unit tests and run them on a desktop JVM while still using Android API.
Robolectric mocks part of the Android framework contained in the _android.jar_ file. 
Robolectric provides also implementations for the methods while the standard Android unit testing support throws exceptions for all Android methods.

This enables you to run your Android tests in your continuous integration environment without any additional setup.
_Robolectric_ supports resource handling, e.g., inflation of `views`.
You can also use the `findViewById()` to search in a `view`.

Robolectric is not an integration test framework, i.e., you cannot not test the interaction of Android components with it.


=== Shadow objects

Robolectric replaced all Android classes by so-called _shadow objects_.
If a method is implemented by Robolectric ,it forwards these method calls to the shadow object.
Shadow objects behave similar to the Android implementation.
If a method is not implemented by the shadow object, it simply returns a default value, e.g., null or 0.

To access a shadow object use `Shadows.shadowOf`.
