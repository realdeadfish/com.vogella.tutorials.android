== Parceable
	
		A
		_Parceable_
		is the Android implementation of the Java Serializable. As it assume a
		certain structure and way of processing it is relatively fast compared
		to the standard Java serialization.
	
	
		To allow your custom object to be parsed to another component they
		need to implement the
		`android.os.Parcelable`
		interface. It must also provide a static final method called
		`CREATOR`
		which must implement the
		`Parcelable.Creator`
		interface.
