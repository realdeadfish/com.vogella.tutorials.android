== Services in separate processes

=== Running a service in its own process

You can also specify that your
`Service`
runs in
a separate
process via the
`<android:process=":process_description">
attribute.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/service/defineservice.xml[]
----

The colon prefix in front of the name tells Android that the
`Service`
is private to its declaring application. If the colon is not used, the
`Service`
would be a global process and can be used by other Android
applications.

Running a service in its own process will not block the
application in case the service performs long running operations in
its main thread. But as the services runs in its own process, you need
to use some interprocess communication (IPC) to communicate to your
service from other parts.

Even if the service
runs in its own process, you need to use
asynchronous processing
to
perform
network access, because Android does not allow network access
in the main thread of a process.

=== When to run a service in a separate process?

Running a service
in its own process gives it its own memory
address space and a
garbage collector of the virtual machine in this
process does not
affect the application process.

Application rarely need to run a service
in its own process.
Running
services in its own process makes the
communication with
other
Android components and the
service
harder to implement.

NOTE: If you want to make a service
to other Android application
available, they must run in their own
process.
