== Exercise: Define and consume local service
	
This exercise demonstrates how to bind to a local
service
from an
activity.
	
The service
is started after the Android device boots and
simulates
that it periodically
fetches
data. The
activity
binds itself to
the service to access its data.
	
Create a new project called
_de.vogella.android.ownservice.local_
with
the
activity
called
_MainActivity_.
	
Create the following
`LocalWordService`
class.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ownservice/LocalWordService.java[]
----	
	
Create the following two classes, which will be registered as
`BroadcastReceivers`.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ownservice/MyScheduleReceiver.java[]
----	
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ownservice/MyStartServiceReceiver.java[]
----	
	
Register all components in your
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/ownservice/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----	
	
Change the
layout file of the
activity
similar to the following example.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/ownservice/main.xml[]
----	
	
Change your
activity
class
to the following code.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ownservice/MainActivity.java[]
----	
	
Run your application. If you press the button, the data is fetched
again from the service and the
`ListView`
is updated.
