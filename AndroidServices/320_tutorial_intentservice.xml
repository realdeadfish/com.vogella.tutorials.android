	<title>Exercise: Using services and service communication
	
		The following example demonstrates how to use a service
		to
		download a file from the Internet based on a button click from an
		activity. Once done, the service notifies the activity via a broadcast
		receiver that the download is complete.
	
	
		In this exercise you use the
		`IntentService`
		class, as this class provides automatic background processing.
	
	
		Create a new project called
		_com.vogella.android.service.receiver_
		with the
		activity
		called
		_MainActivity_.
	
	
		Create the following class for the service.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/intentservice/DownloadService.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		Add this class to the
		_AndroidManifest.xml_
		file. Also add the permission to
		write to external storage and to
		access
		the Internet. The resulting
		_AndroidManifest.xml_
		file should look similar to the following listing.
	
	
		<programlisting language="xml">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/intentservice/AndroidManifest.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		Change the layout file of your activity to the following.
	
	
		<programlisting language="xml">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/intentservice/activity_main.xml" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		Change
		`MainActivity`
		to the following.
	
	
		<programlisting language="java">
			<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"
				parse="text" href="./examples/intentservice/MainActivity.java" />
		</programlisting>
	
	
		If you run your example and press the button, the download should
		be
		performed by the
		service. Once done, the user interface is updated and
		a `Toast` with the file
		name is shown.
	
	
		Change the setting so that the service runs in its own process.
		Ensure that the application still works, as broadcast receivers are
		received across process boundaries.
