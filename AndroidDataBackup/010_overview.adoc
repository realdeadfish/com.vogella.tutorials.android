== Android Data Backup

=== Purpose of data backup

The backup service of Android allows you to copy your persistent
application data to a remote cloud storage. This allows you to
restore the application data and settings in case the
user switches
Android devices, re-installs the application or
performs a factory
reset.

Data backup is not required to be available
on all Android
devices and the actual cloud storage might be customized by the
device
manufacturer. Therefore the Android team guarantees no safety
for the
stored data.

If the service is not
available on your device, the backup
service is not called, hence
it is still
save
to implement this service
and run it on any device.

To use the backup service you have to register your application
package for it
at the following URL:
https://developer.android.com/google/backup/signup.html - Backup service registration
. This webpage allows you to get a backup key for a application
package.

=== Backup of shared preferences and files

For saving and restoring your data you extend the
`BackupAgent`
class.

The simplest way to implement your backup is to use
`SharedPreferencesBackupHelper`
for shared preferences and
`FileBackupHelper`
to backup
files from the internal storage system. Both helper classes
save and restore automatically the registered files.

=== General backup

For a more complex backup you can directly implement the BackupAgent
and its save and restore methods.

for details.
