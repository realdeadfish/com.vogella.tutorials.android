== Robotium
	
		_Robotium_
		is an extension of the Android test framework and was
		created
		to make
		it
		easy to write
		user interface tests for
		Android
		applications.
		Robotium
		tests inherit from
		`ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2`
		and
		allows you to define test
		cases
		across
		Android
		activities.
	
	<note>
		Robotium tests perceive the application under test as black box,
			i.e., it only interacts with the user interface
			and not via the
			internal code of the application.
		
	
	
		The homepage of Robotium is currently located under the following URL:
		http://code.google.com/p/robotium/">Robotium homepage</ulink>
		but is moving to
		https://github.com/RobotiumTech/">Robotium at Github</ulink>
		.
	

	
		Robotium extends the Android test framework to make it simpler to
		write tests. The main class for testing with Robotium
		is
		`Solo`
		.
	

	
		`Solo`
		is initialized with the
		instrumentation of the testcase and
		the first
		activity to test.
