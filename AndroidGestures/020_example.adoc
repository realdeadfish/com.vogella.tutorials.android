== Example
Create a new Android project "de.vogella.android.gestures" with
the activity "GestureTest". Create a few gestures and copy them to
your application as described in the
last chapter.

Unfortunately the UI builder does not support GestureOverlayView,
please see
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1368 - Bug report GestureOverlayView not working in the layout builder
, therefore we have to build a layout without the gesture view and add
this view via code to the GestureOverlayView.

 Create the following layout _main.xml_. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/gestures/main.xml[]
----

Create the following Activity. 

[source,java]
----
include::res/gestures/GestureTest.java[]
----

Start your application. As a result you should be able to perform gestures and see the
result. We only show a Toast but of course you could perform all kind of actions.
