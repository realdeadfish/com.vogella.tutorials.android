== Systrace
	
_Systrace_
allows to measure the performance directly at kernel level. To enable
systrace, select the Developer options and select the
`Enable traces`
entry. In the next dialog you can define what
type of events should be
profiled, e.g.
Graphics and View.

To use systrace, open a terminal and run
_systrace.py_
from the
_android_sdk_installdir/tools/systrace_
directory. You may have to set it to executable (chmod a+x systrace.py
on Linux).
	
You can also start
_Systrace_
directly from Eclipse via the
`DDMS`
perspective.

_Systrace_
captures events for 5 seconds. As result
_Systrace_
creates a HTML file which allows you to analyze potential issues.
