	<title>StrictMode
	
		You should avoid performing long running
		operations
		on the
		UI
		thread.
		This
		includes file and network access.
	

	
		To ensure this you can use
		_StrictMode_
		. StrictMode is available as of API 9 (Android
		2.3.3) and
		allows to
		setup thread policies for your
		application.
	
	
		Via
		_StrictMode_
		you can instruct the Android system to crash your application if
		it
		performs
		long running
		operations, e.g. I/O
		in
		the user interface thread.

	
	
		The following code shows how to use
		_StrictMode_
		. As the
		_activity_
		violates these settings it
		will crash.

	StrictMode
		should only be used
		during
		development and
		not in
		your live
		application.
