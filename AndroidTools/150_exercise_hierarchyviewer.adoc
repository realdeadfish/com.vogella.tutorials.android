== Exercise: Hierarchy Viewer
	
Continue to use the same example as in the Traceview Excercise
. Open the
`Hierarchy View`
_perspective_
and analyze the view layer.
	
While none of these layout layers is very performance intensive
it
contains redundant layers and unnecessary views. Remove the
unnecessary view layers.
