		<title>Overview
		
			The Canvas API allows to create complex graphical effects.
		
		
			You paint on a
			`Bitmap`
			surface.
			The
			`Canvas`
			class provides the drawing methods to draw on a bitmap and the
			`Paint`
			class specifies how you draw on the bitmap.

		<title>The Canvas class
		
			The
			`Canvas`
			object contains the bitmap on which you draw. It also provides
			methods for drawing operations, e.g.
			`drawARGB()`
			for drawing a color,
			`drawBitmap()`
			to draw a
			`Bitmap`
			,
			`drawText()`
			to draw a text,
			`drawRoundRect()`
			to draw a rectangle with rounded corners and much more.

		<title>The Paint class
		
			For drawing on the
			`Canvas`
			object you use an object of type
			`Paint`
			.
		
		
			The
			`Paint`
			class allows to specify the color, font and certain effects for the
			drawing operation.
		
		
			The
			`setStyle()`
			method allows to specify if the  only the outline (
			`Paint.Style.STROKE`
			), the filled part (
			`Paint.Style.FILL`
			) or both (
			`Paint.Style.STROKE_AND_FILL`
			)should be drawn.
		
		
			You can set the alpha channel of the
			`Paint`
			via the
			`setAlpha()`
			method.
		
		
			Via
			_Shaders_
			you can define that the
			`Paint`
			is filled with more than one color.
		
	
	<section id="canvasapi_shader">
		<title>Shader
		
			A shader allows to define for a
			`Paint`
			object the content which should be drawn. For example you can use a
			`BitmapShader`
			to define that a bitmap should be used to draw. This allows you for
			example to draw an image with rounded corners. Simply define a
			`BitmapShader`
			for your
			`Paint`
			object and use the
			`drawRoundRect()`
			method to draw a rectancle with rounded corners.
		
		
			Other
			_Shaders_
			provided by the Android platform are
			`LinearGradient`
			,
			`RadialGradient`
			and
			`SweepGradient`
			for drawing color gradients.
		
		
			To use a
			_Shaders_
			assign it to your
			`Paint`
			object via the
			`setShader()`
			method.
		
		
			If the area which is filled is larger than the
			_Shaders_
			you can define via the
			_Shader tile mode_
			how the rest should be filled. The
			`Shader.TileMode.CLAMP`
			constant
			defines that the edge corners should be used to fill the
			extra space, the
			`Shader.TileMode.MIRROR`
			constant defines that the image is mirrored and
			`Shader.TileMode.REPEAT`
			defines that the image will be repeated.
