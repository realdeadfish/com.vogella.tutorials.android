== Using the support libraries from Google

=== What are the support libraries

The Android Support Library package is a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs.
They also provide features and widgets that are only available through the library APIs. 
Each support library is backward-compatible to a specific Android API level.

In general you find two types of support libraries. The first type provides framework functionality for older API
releases, the second type provides new functionality for all devices. This functionality is either net yet part of the
platform or will never be part of the platform, so that Google can continue to improve it faster than Android platform
API.

=== The support libraries from Google
	
You have different components here. At the time of this writing you
have:

.Support library versions
|===
|Support Library|Description|Gradle dependency

|v4 Support Library
|Designed for Android 1.6 (API level 4) or higher. 
Includes lots of things including support for Fragments and the Loader framework.
|Located in the android-sdk/extras/android/support/v7/appcompat/ directory.

|v7 Support Libraries
|
|Set of libraries which require Android 2.1 (API level 7) and higher. Requires also the v4 Support library.
	
|v7 appcompat library

== Remove usage of the support library from a new project

=== Why would you remove the support library?
		
Support libraries are changing very fast therefore it is hard to create a "stable" description how to use them.
Also unfortunately the templates of Android studio for generating Android projects are changing all the time
and have recently been changed to include the design support library, even if that is not necessary, e.g., in case
you are targeting a recent device.
This
make
testing a new feature or standard API harder
and makes it
harder to follow a tutorial as the
generated
project changes all the time.
		
	
=== Converting a project to a standard Android project

The build dependency in the Gradle build file does not hurt but you need to remove the references to the
compatibility library from your code and your resources.
		
		
For this,
change the code of the generated
activity
to extend
`Activity`
instead of any other activity like
`AppCompatActivity`
. Also, reduces the example code to the minimum. The following is an example for an activity called
`MainActivity`
.

[source,java]
----
include::res/compat/MainActivity.java[]
----		

Also ensures that only standard elements are using the generated layout file. The following is an example
listing for a simple standard layout file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/compat/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
Also ensure that the theme is a default theme, instead of the compatibility theme. For this check the
_app/res/values/styles.xml_
folder to use the standard material theme.
