== Using styles and themes in your application

=== Theming in Android and material design

The Android user interface design guidelines have changes over the years. 
The first big change for designing Android applications came with the Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) release which introduced the _Holo_ style. 
The Android 5.0 (Lollipop) release was again a radical change with the _Material_ design. 
The material design introduces depth into the layout and uses much more animations to provide feedback to the user.

This page also contains several downloadable resources, e.g., an icon set. 
You find the downloads on this website: https://developer.android.com/design/downloads/index.html

As of Android 5.0 (Lollipop, or API 21) the preferred design for Android applications is the _Material design_.

Material design is a guide for visual, motion, and interaction design. 
The Android platform provides a new theme, new widgets and new API for custom shadows and animations.

Material design support that views are drawn on top of other views by assigning an elevation level to them.
Views define an elevation level in dp (density-independent pixels). 
To set the elevation of a view in a layout definition, use the android:elevation attribute. 
To set the elevation of a view in the code of an activity, use the `View.setElevation()` method. 
Android draws customizable shadows based on the value of the elevation.

Material design also provides improved API for animations and provides several default animations.



=== What are styles and themes

Android allow you to define the look and feel, for example, colors and fonts, of Android components in XML resource files.
This way you can set style related  attributes in one central place.

If the entry in the resource file is used to style a view, it is referred to as a _style_.
If it is used for styling an activity or application it is called a _theme_.

To define a style or a theme, save an XML file in the _/res/values_ directory of your project. 
The root node of the XML file must be the `<resources>` tag.
To define a style or a theme, define an entry with the `style` tag and define the `name` attribute. 
This entry can contains one or more items which define values for named attributes.

The following listing is an example for a style definition.

[source,java]
----
include::res/styles/styles.xml[]
----

You assign the style attribute to entries in your layout file via the `style=”@style/text` attribute.

Styles (and themes) support inheritance by using the parent attribute of the style tag. 
This way the style inherits all settings from the parent style and can overwrite selected attributes.

=== Referring attributes in the current theme

Android lists all standard attributes which can be styled in the _R.attr_ file. 
The reference for this file can be found online under the following URL: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html


You can refer to individual attributes of the current Android theme via the `?android:attr` notation.
This notation means that you are referring to a style attribute in the currently active theme.

For example `?android:attr/listPreferredItemHeight` means: "use the value defined by the attribute called listPreferredItemHeight in the current theme.

The following layout defines buttons with the Android 4.0 button style.

=== Themes

A theme is a style applied to an entire activity or application, rather than an individual view.
The technique of defining a theme is the same as defining a style.

The next example show how to define your own theme while extending a platform theme.

[source,java]

include::res/styles/theme.xml[]
