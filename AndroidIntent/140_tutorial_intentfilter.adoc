== Exercise: Register an activity as browser
=== Target
		
In the following exercise you register an activity as browser. 
This means, if an intent is triggered when someone wants to view an URL starting with `http`, your activity will be available to process this intent.
		
The example activity downloads the HTML source of this page and displays it in a `TextView`.
	
=== Create project
		
Create an Android project called _de.vogella.android.intent.browserfilter_ with an activity called `BrowserActivity`.
		
=== Register activity as browser
		
Register your _activity_ to the `Intent.Action_VIEW` action and the scheme "http" via the following changes in your _AndroidManifest.xml_ file.
Ensure that your manifest also declares the permission to access the Internet.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/filter/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----		
		
Change the corresponding layout file according the following listing.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/filter/main.xml[]
----
	
Change your activity class to the following code.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/filter/BrowserActivity.java[]
----

=== Validating

Install your application. 
If you trigger an intent to open a URL, the user should be able to select your custom browser implementation.
Trigger for this purpose the following intent from one of your Android applications by adding for example an additional button to the application which can trigger the code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/filter/StartBrowser.java[]
----
		
If you select your component, the HTML code is loaded and displayed into your `TextView`.

=== Optional: Make it a real browser

TIP: Replace your `TextView` with a `WebView` to create a "real" browser. 
The `WebView` does the loading of the HTTP request for you.
Simply assign the URL via the `loadUrl` method to it.
