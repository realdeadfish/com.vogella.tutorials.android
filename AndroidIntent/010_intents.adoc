== Starting other Android components via intents
    
=== What are intents?
		
_Intents_ are asynchronous messages which allow application components to request functionality from other Android components. 
Intents allow you to interact with components from the same applications as well as with components contributed by other applications.
For example, an activity can start an external activity for taking a picture.
		
		
Intents are objects of the `android.content.Intent` type. 
Your code can send them to the Android system defining the components you are targeting. 
For example, via the `startActivity()` method you can define that the intent should be used to start an activity.
		
		
An intent can contain data via a `Bundle`. 
This data can be used by the receiving component.

In Android the reuse of other application components is a concept known as _task_. 
An application can access other Android components to achieve a task.
For example, from a component of your application you can trigger another component in the Android system, which manages photos, even if this component is not part of your application. 
In this component you select a photo and return to your application to use the selected photo.
        
Such a flow of events is depicted in the following graphic.

=== Starting activities
		
To start an activity, use the method `startActivity(intent)`. 
This method is defined on the `Context` object which `Activity` extends.

The following code demonstrates how you can start another activity via an intent.

Activities which are started by other Android activities are called _sub-activities_. 
This wording makes it easier to describe which activity is meant.
		
=== Starting services
		
You can also start services via intents. 
Use the `startService(Intent)` method call for that.
		
=== Sending out explicit or implicit intents
		
Android supports explicit and implicit intents.
An application can define the target component directly in the intent (_explicit intent_) or ask the Android system to evaluate registered components based on the intent data(_implicit intents_).
		
Explicit intents explicitly define the component which should be called by the Android system, by using the Java class as identifier.
Explicit intents are typically used within on application as the classes in an application are controlled by the application developer.
The following shows how to create an explicit intent and send it to the Android system to start an activity.

Implicit intents specify the action which should be performed and optionally data which provides content for the action.
If an implicit intent is sent to the Android system, it searches for all components which are registered for the specific action and the fitting data type.
If only one component is found, Android starts this component directly.
If several components are identified by the Android system, the user will get a selection dialog and can decide which component should be used for the intent.

For example, the following tells the Android system to view a webpage.
All installed web browsers should be registered to the corresponding intent data via an intent filter.
