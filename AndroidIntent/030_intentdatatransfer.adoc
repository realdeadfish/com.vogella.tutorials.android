== Data transfer between activities

=== Data transfer to the target component
		
An intent contains certain header data, e.g., the desired action, the type, etc. 
Optionally an intent can also contain additional data based on an instance of the `Bundle` class which can be retrieved from the intent via the `getExtras()` method.
		
		
You can also add data directly to the `Bundle` via the overloaded `putExtra()` methods of the `Intent` objects. 
Extras are key/value pairs. The key is always of type `String`. 
As value you can use the primitive data types (`int`, `float`, ...) plus objects of type `String`, `Bundle`, `Parceable` and `Serializable`.
		
The receiving component can access this information via the `getAction()` and `getData()` methods on the `Intent` object. 
This `Intent` object can be retrieved via the `getIntent()` method.
		
The component which receives the intent can use the `getIntent().getExtras()` method call to get the extra data. 
That is demonstrated in the following code snippet.

=== Example: Using the share intent
		
Lots of Android applications allow you to share some data with other people, e.g., the Facebook, G+, Gmail and Twitter application.
You can send data to one of these components. 
The following code snippet demonstrates the usage of such an intent within your application.

=== Retrieving result data from a sub-activity
		
An activity can be closed via the back button on the phone. 
In this case the `finish()` method is performed.
If the activity was started with the `startActivity(Intent)`method call, the caller requires no result or feedback from the activity which now is closed.
		
If you start the activity with the `startActivityForResult()`method call, you expect feedback from the sub-activity. 
Once the sub-activity ends, the `onActivityResult()` method on the sub-activity is called and you can perform actions based on the result.
		
In the `startActivityForResult()` method call you can specify a result code to determine which activity you started. 
This result code is returned to you. 
The started activity can also set a result code which the caller can use to determine if the activity was canceled or not.

The sub-activity uses the `finish()` method to create a new intent and to put data into it.
It also sets a result via the `setResult()` method call.
		
The following example code demonstrates how to trigger an _intent_ with the `startActivityForResult()` method.

If you use the `startActivityForResult()` method, then the started _activity_ is called a _sub-activity_.
		
If the sub-activity is finished, it can send data back to its caller via an _Intent_.
This is done in the `finish()` method.

Once the sub-activity finishes, the `onActivityResult()` method in the calling _activity_ is called.
