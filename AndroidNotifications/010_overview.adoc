== Notification Manager

=== Notification Manager

Android allows to put notification into the titlebar of your
application.
The user can expand the notification bar and by selecting
the
notification the user can trigger
another activity.

Because notifications can be very annoying, the user can disable
notifications for each application. This can be done via the Settings
application of the Android
device. Select
`Apps`
in the Settings, select the app you are interested in
and unset the
`Show notifications`
checkbox to prevent the app to show notifications.

=== Setting up Notifications

Notifications in Android are represented by the
`Notification`
class.
To create notifications you use the
`NotificationManager`
class which can be received from the
`Context`
, e.g. an
_activity_
or a
_service_
,
via the
`getSystemService()`
method.

The
`Notification.Builder`
provides an builder interface to create an
`Notification`
object. You use a
`PendingIntent`
to specify the action which should be performed once the user select
the notification.

The
`Notification.Builder`
allows you to add up to three buttons with definable actions to the
notification.

Android 4.1 supports expandable notifications. In addition to
normal
notification view it is possible to define a big view
which gets
shown
when notification is expanded. There are three
styles to be used
with
the big view: big picture style, big text
style, Inbox style. The
following code demonstrates the usage of the
`BigTextStyle()`
which allows to use up to 256
dp.

=== Canceling Notifications

The user can dismiss all notification or if you set your
notification to auto-cancel it is also removed once the user selects
it.

You can also call the
`cancel()`
for a specific notification ID on the
`NotificationManager`
. The
`cancelAll()`
method call removes all
of the notifications you
previously issued.
