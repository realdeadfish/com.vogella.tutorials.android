== Using the toolbar 
=== Creating actions in the toolbar
		
Entries in the toolbar are typically called _actions_. 
While it is possible to create entries in the action bar via code, it is typically defined in an XML resource file.
		
Each menu definition is contained in a separate file in the _res/menu_ folder. 
The Android tooling automatically creates a reference to menu item entries in the `R` file, so that the menu resource can be accessed.
		
An activity adds entries to the action bar in its `onCreateOptionsMenu()` method.
		
The `showAsAction` attribute allows you to define how the action is displayed. 
For example, the `ifRoom` attribute defines that the action is only displayed in the action bar if there is sufficient screen space available.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/actionbar/menuexample.xml[]
----
		
The `MenuInflator` class allows to inflate actions defined in an XML file and adds them to the action bar.
`MenuInflator` can get accessed via the `getMenuInflator()` method from your _activity_. 
The following example code demonstrates the creation of actions.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/actionbar/inflate.java[]
----

TIP: While you can define the actions also in your source code, it is good practice to do this via XML files, as this results in less boilerplate code.

=== Reacting to action selection
		
If an action is selected, the `onOptionsItemSelected()` method in the corresponding activity is called. 
It receives the selected action as parameter. 
The usage of this method is demonstrated in the following code snippet.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/actionbar/reacting.java[]
----		
	
=== Search an action in the action bar
		
To search for a menu item in a menu you can use the `findItem()` method of the `Menu` class. 
This method allows to search by id.
		
=== Changing the menu
		
The `onCreateOptionsMenu()` method is only called once. 
If you want to change the menu later, you have to call the `invalidateOptionsMenu()` method. 
Afterwards this `onCreateOptionsMenu()` method is called again.
		
=== Making the toolbar context sensitive with the contextual action mode
	
A contextual action mode activates a temporary toolbar that overlays the application toolbar for the duration of a particular sub-task.
	
The contextual action mode is typically activated by selecting an item or by long clicking on it.
	
To implement this, call the `startActionMode()` method on a viewor on your activity. 
This method gets an `ActionMode.Callback` object which is responsible for the life cycle of the contextual action bar.
	
You could also assign a context menu to a view via the `registerForContextMenu(view)` method. 
A context menu is also activated if the user "long presses" the view. 
The `onCreateContextMenu()` method is called every time a context menu is activated as the context menu is discarded after its usage.
You should prefer the contextual action mode over the usage of context menus.

=== Contributing to the action bar with fragments
	
Fragments can also contribute entries to the toolbar bar.
	
To do this, call `setHasOptionsMenu(true)` in the `onCreate()` method of the fragment. 
The Android framework calls in this case the `onCreateOptionsMenu()` method in the fragment class.
Here the fragment can adds menu items to the toolbar.
	

=== Changing the visibility of the toolbar bar

You can change the visibility of the toolbar at runtime. 
The following code demonstrates that.

[source,java]
----
include::res/modify/hide.java[]
----

You can also change the text which is displayed alongside the application icon at runtime. 
The following example shows that.

[source,java]
----
include::res/modify/title.java[]
----

=== Assigning a Drawable

You also add a `Drawable` to the action bar as background via the `ActionBar.setBackgroundDrawable()` method.

The toolbar scales the image. 
Therefore it is best practice to provide a scalable drawable , e.g., a 9-patch or XML drawable.

As of Android 4.2 the background of the action bar can also be animated via an `AnimationDrawable`.

=== Dimming the navigation buttons

You can also dim the software navigation button in your Android application to have more space available. 
If the user touches the button of the screen, the navigation button is automatically shown again.

Dimming the navigation buttons is demonstrated by the following code snippet.

[source,java]
----
include::res/navigation/hide.java[]
----

The following screenshots show an application with and without the navigation buttons.

=== Using immersive full screen mode

As of Android 4.4 (API 19) you can put your application into full screen mode. 
The first time this happens the system displays the user the info that he can restore the system bars with a downward swipe along the region where the system bars normally appear.

For example the following method also to put an activity into full screen mode.

[source,java]
----
include::res/navigation/immersivemode.java[]
----

=== Enabling the split toolbar

You can define that the toolbar should be automatically split by the system if not enough space is available.

You can activate this via the `android:uiOptions="SplitActionBarWhenNarrow"` parameter in the declaration of your application activity in the _AndroidManifest.xml_ file.

NOTE: If this option is activated, Android has the option to split the toolbar. 
Whether to split is decided by the system at runtime.
