== Getting the Google Map key

=== Google console
		
To use Google Maps you need to create a valid Google Maps API
key. The key is free, you can use it with any of your applications
that call the Maps API, and it supports an unlimited number of
users.
		
You get this key via the
https://code.google.com/apis/console/ - Google APIs Console. 
You have to provide your application signature key and the
application package
name.
		
This is based
on the
key with which you sign your Android
application
during
deployment. During development with Eclipse, Eclipse us
automatically
creates
and uses a
_debug key_
.
	
=== Creating the SHA-1 for your signature key
		
The Eclipse debug
key for signing your application can be found in the
_userhome/.android/debug.keystore_
file.
		
To create the SHA-1 for your debug keystore you use the
`keytool`
command from your JDK
installation pointing to the
_debug.keystore_
file.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/maps/key.txt[]
----
		
Copy the SHA-1 output, as you need this later.
	
=== Register with the Google APIs Console
		
You have to register in
the
_Google APIs Console_
that you want to use Google Maps for Android. You can reach this
console via the following link:
https://code.google.com/apis/console/[ Google APIs Console]
. Select here the
`Services`
entry.

Activate the
`Google Maps Android API v2`.

=== Create key for your application
		
You need later to register your application via its package in
this
console together with the SHA-1 fingerprint of your signature
key. For
this you select the entry and click on the
`API Access`
entry. Afterwards click on the
_Create new Android key..._
entry.

Enter your SHA-1 fingerprint and the package of your application
separated by a semicolon. For example you can use the
`com.vogella.android.locationapi.maps`
package.
