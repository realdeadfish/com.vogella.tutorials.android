== Exercise: Creating Android applications with different product flavors
=== Target for this exercise
		
In this exercise you create an Android application with two different project flavors, called _prod_ and _mock_.
	
		
The mock version defines different resources than the prod version.
In this first sample the strings.xml file of the main folder/project is overridden.
Which variant is build is defined via the _Build Variants_ view. 
	
=== Creating a new Android application
		
Create a new Project with the _Blank Activity_ template and the top level package `com.vogella.android.gradlebuildflavors`.
	
		
Define two additional product flavors in the _app/build.gradle_ file called "prod" and "mock".

[source,java]
....
include::res/gradle/productFlavours_complete.build[]
....	

Create the desired folder structure for prod and mock flavors. See <<androidstudio_creatingresourcefolder>> and <<androidstudio_creatingresourcefile>> for further information. 
If you select _Android resource directory_ you can select the flavor in the following dialog as depicted in the next screenshot.

Copy the _strings.xml_ from the _main_ folder to the appropriate folder of the flavor.
	
		
Change the `hello_world` string of the _strings.xml_ to _Mock World!_ and _Prod World!_ accordingly.
	
[source,xml]
....
include::res/gradle/free_strings.xml[]
....

[source,java]
....
include::res/gradle/paid_strings.xml[]
....

=== Validate
		
Select `mockDebug` as _Build Variant_ in the _Build Variants_ view of Android Studio and run your app.

If you start you application you should see the string from the mock flavor. 
Select now you prod flavor and start it, you should see the other string.		

	
=== Build via Gradle command line
		
Use the `./gradlew build` command to build all your product flavors.

=== Prepare your application for testing with Gradle flavors

Create a class `ShareIntentBuilder` which starts an activity via the  “share intent” via a static method with the following code.

[source,java]
----
import android.content.Context;
import android.content.Intent;

public class ShareIntentBuilder {

    public static void startSendActivity(Context context, String title, String body) {
        Intent intent = new Intent();
        intent.setAction(Intent.ACTION_SEND);
        intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TITLE, title);
        intent.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_TEXT, body);
        intent.setType("text/plain");
        Intent chooserIntent = Intent.createChooser(intent, context.getResources().getText(R.string.share));
        chooserIntent.addFlags(Intent.FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK);
        context.startActivity(chooserIntent);
    }

----

Allow the activity which triggers this intent to be replaced in your “mock” flavor
If in a flavor “mock” is selected, start a second activity in your application which displays the send data.
If the flavor "prod" is selected send the shared intent.

NOTE: Classes cannot be overriden, you need to create the classes in their specific flavors and not in the main flavor.
