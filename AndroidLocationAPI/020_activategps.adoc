== Using GPS and setting the current location

=== Activating GPS on the emulator
		
You need to activate GPS on your test device. If you test on the
emulator and its not activated you
"null" if you try to use a
`LocationManager`.
		
The Google Map
_activity_
should automatically activate the GPS device in the emulator but if
you
want to use the location manager directly you need to do this
yourself.
Currently their seems to be an issue with this.
		
Start Google Maps on the emulator and request the current
geo-position, this
will allow you to activate the
GPS. Send new GPS
coordinates to the Android emulator.
		
=== Setting the geoposition
		
You can use the "DDMS"
`Perspective`
of Eclipse to send your geoposition to the emulator or a connected
device. For open this
`Perspective`
select
menu:Window[Open Perspective > Other... > DDMS].
		
In the Emulator Control part you can enter the geocoordinates
and press the _Send_ button.

You can also set the geoposition the Android emulator via
telnet.
Open a console and connect to your device. The port number of
your
device can be seen in the title area of your emulator.
