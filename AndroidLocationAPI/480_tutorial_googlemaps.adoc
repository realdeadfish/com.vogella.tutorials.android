== Tutorial: Google Maps

=== Create Project
		
In the following chapter we will build an Android application which
shows a
`MapView`
. It also shows a compass and the current geoposition. Via an
`ItemizedOverlay`
implementation we will also display the last 5 positions on the map.
		
Create a new Android project called
"de.vogella.android.locationapi.maps" with an
_activity_
called
_ShowMapActivity_. Make sure to select the "Google API" als
Target.
		
Add the following permissions to your application.

*INTERNET
*ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION        
*ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION        

=== Validate AndroidManifest.xml
		
Validate that your
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file looks similiar to
the following file.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/maps/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----

=== ItemizedOverlay
		
Create the following
`MyOverlays`
class which extends
`ItemizedOverlay`
class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/maps/MyOverlays.java[]
----
		
We will later use an image called
_point_. Put one icon called
_point_, e.g. "point.png"
in at least on of your drawable folder. If
you
do not know where to find
icons,
you can
copy the icons created by the
Android
wizard.
		
=== Layout
		
Create a
`MapView`
key as described earlier.
		
Change the
_main.xml_
layout file in your
_res/layout_
folder to
the
following.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/maps/main.xml[]
----		
		
Replace
`your_key`
with your Google Maps API
key.
		
=== Activity

Change your
_activity_
to the following. This
_activity_
use an
`LocationListner`
to update the
`MapView`
with the current location.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/maps/ShowMapActivity.java[]
----
	
=== Run and Test
		
Run and test your application. You should be able to zoom in and
out
and send new geo coordinates to your
_activity_
via the Emulator.
