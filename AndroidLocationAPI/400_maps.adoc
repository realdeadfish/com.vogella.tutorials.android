== Google Maps

=== MapsView

Google provides via the
`com.google.android.maps`
package a library for using the
`MapView`
class
in your application. This view allows to embed Google Maps into
your application.

You require an additional key to use them.
This
key will be specified
in the layout file
for the
`MapView`.

You need to add the
information that you will be using the
`map`
library to your
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file
The Android
project creation wizard in Eclipse does this
automatically, if
you select a
Google
API version.

The usage of
`MapView`
requires the permission to access
the Internet, as the data displayed
in the
`MapView`
is downloaded from the Internet.

=== MapsActivity

The
`MapActivity`
class
extends the
_activity_
class and provides the
life cycle management and the services for
displaying a
`MapView`
widget.

MapActivity simplify the handling
`MapViews`
similar to
`ListActivity`
simplifies the usage of
`ListViews`
.

A
`MapView`
is typically defined in the XML layout file used by the
`MapActivity`
and requires the API key in the "android:apiKey" attribute. A
`MapView`
can be used with other user interface components in the same layout.

The
`MapController`
class can be used to interact with the
`MapView`
, e.g. by moving it. A
`Geopoint`
is a position described via
latitude
and longitude.

=== Build in Zoom controls

`MapView`
allows to activate the build in zoom controls via the
`.setBuiltInZoomControls()`
method call.

=== MyLocationOverlay

The
`MyLocationOverlay`
class allow to display the current geolocation and allows to enable a
compass.

The following code snippet shows how you can register
myLocationOverlay for your
`MapView`
.

----

You also have a enable and disable myLocationOverview and the compass
in the
`onResume()`
method and in the
`onPause()`
method.

=== ItemizedOverlay and OverlayItems

You can put instances of the
`Overlay`
class
on the map.
`Overlay`
is the base class representing an overlay which may be displayed
on
top of a map. To add an overlay, subclass this class, create an
instance, and add it to the list obtained from MapView.getOverlays().

`ItemizedOverlay`
is the base class for an
`Overlay`
which consists of a list of
`OverlayItems`
.
`ItemizedOverlay`
handles sorting north-to-south for drawing, creating span
bounds,
drawing a marker for each point, and maintaining a focused
item. It
also matches screen-taps to items, and dispatches
Focus-change events
to an optional listener.
	
=== Getting the Google Map key

To use Google Maps you need to create a valid key. This is based
on the
key with which you sign your Android application during
deployment. If you develop with Eclipse, Eclipse automatically
creates
and uses a debug key based on the
"userhome"/.android/debug.keystore
file.

To create the key you use the "keytool" command from your JDK
installation pointing to the "debug.keystore" file.

[source,java]
----
include::res/maps/key.txt[]
----

If you are using Java7 the default output of keytool has changed. Add
the
<parameter class='option'>-v`
to see also the MD5 fingerprint.

The output of this command must be copied and entered on the
following
website:
http://code.google.com/android/maps-api-signup.html - Google Maps Signup Page
.



The procedure is described in detail in the following link:
http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html - Getting a Google Maps key.

=== Device with Google API

In case you want to use Google Maps in your emulator you have to
create a device which supports the Google API's. This
requires
that
you
also install the "Google API". During
device creation select the
target
Google API's in the
version of your
SDK.
