=== Create projects and add the Gradle dependency

Create a new Android project using the `com.vogella.android.recylerview` top level package name.
		
Add the following dependency to your Gradle build file to use RecylerView.

[source,gradle]
----
dependencies {
    ...
    compile "com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:23.0.1"
}
----
		
=== Create layout files
		
Create or update the a layout file called _activity_main.xml_ so that it contains the `RecyclerView`
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/recyclerview/activity_main.xml[]
----

Note: The `ImageView` has the `android:elevation` attribute set, this instructs Android to draw a shadow for it.

Also create a layout to use in each item.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/recyclerview/rowlayout_complex.xml[]
----
		

Note: At the moment the display of the `RecyclerView` is not supported in the graphical preview.

Create the following adapter class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/recyclerview/MyAdapter.java[]
----

Now you can configure your recyler view in your activity.

[source,java]
----
include::res/recyclerview/Activity.java[]
----
