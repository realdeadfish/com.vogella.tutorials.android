== Android and list or grids

=== Using lists or grids in Android
		
The display of elements in a list or grids is a very common pattern in mobile applications.
The user sees a collection of items and can scroll through them. 
The collection of items can be a list, a grid or another structured representations of data.
Such an activity is depicted in the following picture.

The user interacts with the collection of items via touch events or the toolbar.
Individual items can be selected. 
This selection may update the toolbar or may trigger a detailed screen based on the selection.
The following graphic sketches that.

=== Using RecyclerView 
		
The `RecyclerView` class supports the display of a collection of data.

It is a modernized version of the `ListView` and the `GridView` classes provided by the Android framework.
Recycler view addresses several issues that the existing widgets have.
It enforced a programming style that results in good performance.
It also comes with default animations for removing and adding elements.
		
`RecyclerView` allow to use different layout managers for positioning items.

Recycler view uses a `ViewHolder` to store references to the views for one entry in the recycler view. 
A `ViewHolder` class is a static inner class in your adapter which holds references to the relevant views. 
With these references your code can avoid the time-consuming `findViewById()` method to update the widgets with new data.
		
=== Adapters
		
An _adapter_ manages the data model and adapts it to the individual entries in the widget. 
It extends the `RecyclerView.Adapter` class and is assiged to the recycler view via the `RecyclerView.setAdapter` method.
The input to the adapter of an recycler view can be any arbitrary Java objects. 
Based on this input the adapter must return the total number of items via its `getItemCount()` method.

The adapter  prepares the layout of the items by inflating the correct layout for the individual data elements.
This work is done in the `onCreateViewHolder` method.
It returns an object of type `ViewHolder` per visual entry in the recycler view.

This instance is used to access the views in the inflated layout. 
The `onCreateViewHolder` method is only called then a new view must be created.

Every visible entry in a recycler view is filled with the correct data model item by the adapter. 
Once a data item becomes visible, the adapter assigns this data to the individual widgets which he inflated earlier.
This work in done in the `onBindViewHolder` method.
		
For example, an entry in a list may have an image on the left side and two text lines in the middle as depicted in the following graphic.

A layout file for a such a line might look like the following.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/snippets/rowlayout_complex.xml[]

=== Default layout manager
		
The layout manager decides how the data in the `RecyclerView` is displayed. 
The recycler view library provides the following build-in layout managers.

* LinearLayoutManager shows items in a vertical or horizontal scrolling list.
* GridLayoutManager shows items in a grid.
* StaggeredGridLayoutManager shows items in a staggered grid.
		
		
=== Relevant implementation classes to use RecyclerView
		
The implementation of `RecyclerView` requires a few classes to be implemented.
The most important classes are listed in the following table

.Table Important classes of the RecyclerView API
[cols="1, 3, 1"]
|===
|Class |Purpose|Optional

|Adapter
|Provides the data and responsible for creating the views for the individual entry
|Required

|ViewHolder
|Contains references for all views that are filled by the data of the entry
|Required

|LayoutManager
|Contains references for all views that are filled by the data of the entry
|Required, but default implementations available

|ItemDecoration
|Responsible for drawing decorations around or on top of the view container of an entry
|Default behavior, but can be overridden

|ItemAnimator
|Responsible to define the animation if entries are added, removed or reordered
|Default behavior, but can be overridden

|===
		
You can also provide your custom implementations for the layout managers and animations.
		

=== Handling click events in recycler view
Touch events, like clicking should be handled by the views in the recycler view. 
If the view should trigger something in the object in which it is used (activity or fragment), you can pass via the constructor of the adapter to it. 
This allows the adapter to store a reference to the object and call its methods for feedback.
		

=== Using different layouts in recycler view
		
The adapter needs to create a layout for each row of the list.
This root of the layout is typically a
`ViewGroup`
(layout manager)
and contains several other
views
, e.g., an
`ImageView`
and a
`TextView`
. The following graphic shows a list with different layouts for odd
and even rows.
		
image::adapter10.png[Adapter provides data and defines the layout per row,pdfwidth=60%]
		
		
Within the
`getItemViewType`
method the recycler view determines which type should be used for data. The framework call automatically the
`onCreateViewHolder`
method if needed for this type. In this method you inflate the correct layout for the type and return a fitting view
holder.
		

=== Custom animations
		
To customize the animations in the `RecyclerView`, implement your own animation by extending the
`RecyclerView.ItemAnimator`
class and use the RecyclerView.setItemAnimator() method to assign it
to your widget.
		
=== Filtering and sorting
		
Filtering and sorting of the data is handled by the adapter. 
You need to implement the logic in your custom adapter implementation.
		
=== Data updates in the adapter
		
The `notifyItemInserted(position)` method on the adapter can be used to notify the view that a new entry has been inserted at a certain position.
		
The `notifyItemRemoved(position);` method can be used to notify the view that a entry has been deleted in a certain position.
