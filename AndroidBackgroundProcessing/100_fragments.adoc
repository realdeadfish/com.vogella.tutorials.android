== Fragments and background processing

=== Retain instance during configuration changes
		
You can use
fragments
without user interface and retain them between configuration changes
via a call to their
`setRetainInstance()`
method.
		
This way your
`Thread`
or
`AsyncTask`
is retained during configuration changes. This allows you to perform
background processing without explicitly considering the lifecycle of
your
_activity_
.

=== Headless fragments
		
If you perform background processing you can dynamically attached a
headless
_fragment_
to your application and call
`setRetainInstance()`
to true. This fragment is retained during configuration changes and
you can perform asynchronous processing in it.
