== Exercise: activity lifecycle and threads

The following example will download an image from the Internet
in a thread and displays a dialog until the download is done. We will
make sure that the thread is preserved even if the activity is
restarted and that the dialog is correctly displayed and closed.
	
For this example create a new Android project called
_de.vogella.android.threadslifecycle_
with the Activity called
_ThreadsLifecycleActivity_
. Also add the
permission to use the
Internet to your
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.

Your
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file should look like the following.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/lifecycle/AndroidManifest.xml[]
----	
	
Change the layout
_main.xml_
to the following.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/lifecycle/main.xml[]
----
	
Now adjust your activity. In this activity the thread is saved
and the dialog is closed if the activity
is destroyed.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/lifecycle/ThreadsLifecycleActivity.java[]
----
	
Run your application and press the button to start a download.
You can
test the correct lifecycle
behavior by changing the orientation
in the
emulator via the
kbd:[Ctrl+F11]
shortcut.
	
	
It is important to note that the
`Thread`
is a static inner
class.
It is important to use a static inner class for
your background
process because otherwise
the inner class will contain a
reference to
the class in which is was
created. As the thread is passed
to the new
instance of your activity
this would create a memory leak as
the old
activity would still be
referred to by the Thread.
