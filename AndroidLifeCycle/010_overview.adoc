== Managing the application life cycle

In an ideal case all
Android applications started by the user
remain in memory, that makes
restarting applications faster. But in
reality the available memory on an Android device is limited. To
manage
these limited
resources the Android
system is
allowed to terminate
running
processes or
recycling Android
components.
	
If the Android system needs to free up resources it follows a
simple set of rules. Every process gets a priority in the following
order.
	
If the Android system needs to terminate processes it follows the
following priority system.

.Priorities
|===
|Process status |Description |Priority
	
|Foreground
|An application in which the user is interacting with an activity, or which has an service which is bound to such an activity. 
Also if a service is executing one of its lifecycle methods or a broadcast receiver which runs its `onReceive()` method.
|1

|Visible
|User is not interacting with the activity, but the activity is still (partially) visible or the application has a service which is used by a inactive but visible activity.
|2

|Service
|Application with a running service which does not qualify for 1 or 2.
|3

|Background
|Application with only stopped activities and without a service or executing receiver. 
Android keeps them in a least recent used (LRU) list and if requires terminates the one which was least used.
|4

|Empty
|Application without any active components.
|5
|===
	
All processes in the "Empty" list are added
to a least
recently used list (LRU list) and the processes which are at
the
beginning of this lists are killed by the out-of-memory killer if
required. If an application is restarted by the user its gets moved to
the end of this queue if it reaches the lowest prio again, as
indicated by the following graphic.
