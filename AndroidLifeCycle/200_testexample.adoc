== Exercise: Lifecycle

=== Target of this exercise

In this exercise you create an application which allows you to observe the life cycle call of the Android system to your Android application.

=== Create project

Create a new project called _com.vogella.android.lifecycle.activity_.

Create the following class which is used to report life cycle events via notifications.

[source,java]
----
include::res/report/TracerActivity.java[]
----

=== Create your activities

Create two activities which extend this one. The first activity
should
allow to start the second one via an
`Intent`
.

[source,java]
----
include::res/report/MainActivity.java[]
----

[source,java]
----
include::res/report/SecondActivity.java[]
----

WARNING: Ensure that both activities are registered in the Android manifest.

=== Testing

Start your application and trigger the second activity. Review
the notifications and ensure you know why this order of things are
happening.

Press the Back button on the second activity. 
Validate that `onSaveInstanceState()` is not called. 
Explain why it is not called.

Press the home button on the second activity. 
Validate that `onSaveInstanceState()` is called. 
Explain why it is called.

Start the second activity. 
Switch the orientation of your emulator and see which lifecycle methods of the activity are called.
Is the first activity also re-created or only the second one?

Activate the `Don't keep activities` setting in the _Developer Options_. 
Test again which methods are called.

=== Instance state

Create a string array and add a `Spinner` view to your first activity using this array. 
The following lists the _strings.xml_ and the layout file used by the first activity.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/report/strings.xml[]
----

[source,xml]
----
include::res/report/activity_main.xml[]
----

Android restores the state of a spinner automatically.
Ensure that the selection of the spinner is saved and restored between configuration changes or restarts of the activity by the Android system.

Remove now the fixed array assignment in the layout and assign it to the `Spinner` via source code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/spinner/SpinnerConfig.java[]
----

Remove the fixed assignment in your layout file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/report/activity_main2.xml[]
----

Validate that in this case the position in the spinner is still automatically restored.
