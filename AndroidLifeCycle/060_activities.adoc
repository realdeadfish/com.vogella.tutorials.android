== Activity life cycle

=== States of an activity

An activity can be in different states depending how it is
interacting with the user. These states are described by the
following table.

.Activity state
|===
|State |Description

|Running
|Activity is visible and interacts with the user.

|Paused
|Activity is still visible but partially obscured, instance is running but might be killed by the system.

|Stopped
|Activity is not visible, instance is running but might be killed by the system.

|Killed
|Activity has been terminated by the system of by a call to its `finish()` method.

=== The live cycle methods
		
The Android
system
defines a
life-cycle
for
activities
via predefined
life-cycle methods. The most important methods
are:
.Important Activity lifecycle methods
|===
|Method |Purpose

|onCreate()
|Called then the activity is created. 
Used to initialize the activity, for example create the user interface.

|onResume()
|Called if the _activity_ get visible again and the user starts interacting with the activity again. 
Used to initialize fields, register listeners, bind to services, etc.

|onPause()
|Called once another activity gets into the foreground. 
Always called before the _activity_ is not visible anymore. 
Used to release resources or save application data. For example you unregister listeners, intent receivers, unbind from services or remove system service listeners.

|onStop()
|Called once the activity is no longer visible. 
Time or CPU intensive shut-down operations, such as writing information to a database should be down in the `onStop()` method. 
This method is guaranteed to be called as of API 11.

The life cycle of an activity with its most important methods is
displayed in the following diagram.

Android has more life cycle methods but not all of these methods
are
guaranteed to be called. The
`onDestroy()`
method is not guaranteed to be called, hence you
typically do not use
it.
		
For more information on the other methods
see http://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html - Activity life cycle - Official documentation.
		
=== Termination of activities by Android

The Android system is allowed to recycle Android activities
to
free up
resources. In theory the Android system is allowed to
terminate
individual activities but in reality the Android system
never recycles
individual activities it always determines the whole process
following the rules outlined in http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidLifeCycle/article.html#applicationlifecyle_lifecycle.
		
NOTE: It is a common misunderstanding that Android also kills individual activities, because
http://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html#Lifecycle - the official life-cycle Android documentation describes this. 
However Dianne Hackborn from the core Android team involved in the out of memory killer implementation clarified on Stackoverflow that the Android system only kill processes and not individual activities. 
See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7536988/android-app-out-of-memory-issues-tried-everything-and-still-at-a-loss/7576275#7576275 - Dianas Answer on Stackoverflow.

NOTE: To ensure its state is saved, the activity needs to store the state of the activity at the right point in time and restore it. 
It should stop any unnecessary actions if the
activity is not visible
anymore to save
system resources.
		
You typically use the
`onPause()`
method to stop framework listeners and UI updates and use the
`onStop()`
method to save the application data. These methods are guaranteed to
be called before the activity is terminated. The
`onResume()`
is used to register again listeners and to trigger UI updates based
on the saved data, if necessary.
		
In addition to resource management, Android also recreates
activities
in case a configuration change occurs. The
`Configuration`
object contains the current device configuration, if this
configuration changes activities are restarted, as they may use
different resources for this configuration.
