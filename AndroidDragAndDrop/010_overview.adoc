== Android drag and drop

=== Using drag and drop in Android
		
As of Android 4.0 drag and drop of
view onto other views or view
groups
is supported.
		
=== Allowing a view to be dragged
		
To use dragging a view you register a
`OnTouchListener`
or a
`LongClickListener`
on the
view which can be dragged.
		
The
`startDrag`
method of the
`View`
start a drag operation. In this method you also specify the data
which is passed to the drop target via an instance of
`ClipData`
.
		
You also pass to the
`startDrag`
method an instance of
`DragShadowBuilder`
.
This object specifies the picture used for the drag operation. For
example you can
pass in the
view
directly, that shows an image of the
view during the drag
operation.
		
The setup of this drag operation in a touch listener is
demonstrated in the
following
example.

=== Defining drop target
		
The views which can
be drop targets get an instance of
`OnDragListener`
assigned. In this drop listener you receive call backs in case of
predefined drag and drop related events.
* DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_STARTED
* DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_ENTERED
* DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_EXITED
* DragEvent.ACTION_DROP
* DragEvent.ACTION_DRAG_ENDED
		
A view
with
`OnDragListener`
which are used as a drop zone, gets a
`OnDragListener`
assigned via the
`setOnDragListener`
.
