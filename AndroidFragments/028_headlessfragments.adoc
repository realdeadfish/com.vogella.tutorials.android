== Fragments for background processing

=== Headless Fragments

Fragments can be used without defining a user interface. 
These are called _headless fragments_.
To implement such a fragment, return  `null` in the `onCreateView()` method of your fragment.

[TIP]
====
It is recommended to use services for background processing. 
If you want to do this via your fragments, the second best solution is to use headless fragments in combination with the `setRetainInstance()` method. 
This way you don't have to handle the configuration changes during your asynchronous processing yourself.

=== Retained headless fragments to handle configuration changes

_Headless fragment_ are typically used to encapsulate some state across configuration changes or for a background processing task. 
For this purpose you would set your headless fragment to be retained. 
A retained fragment is not destroyed during configuration changes.

To set your fragment to retained, call its `setRetainInstance()` method.

To add such a fragment to an activity you use the `add()` method of the `FragmentManager` class. 
If you need to refer to this _Fragment_ later, you need to add it with a tag. 
This allows you  to search for it via the `findFragmentByTag()` method of the `FragmentManager`.


The usage of the `onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()` in the activity  is deprecated and should be replaced by retained headless fragments.
