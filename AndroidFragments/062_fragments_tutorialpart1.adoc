== Exercise: Using fragments

=== Target of this exercise
		
The following tutorial demonstrates how to use fragments in a standard Android application without using the support library.
The application uses layouts with different fragments depending on portrait and landscape mode.
		
In portrait mode the _RssfeedActivity_ shows one fragment.
From this fragment the user can navigate to another _activity_ which contains another fragment.
		
		
In landscape mode _RssfeedActivity_ shows both fragments side by side.
		
		
=== Create Project
	
Create a new Android project with the following data. Do NOT use the compability layer.

Table Android project
|===
|Property |Value

|Application Name
|RSS Reader

|Company Domain
|android.example.com

|Package name
|com.example.android.rssreader

|Template
|Empty Activity

|Activity
|RssfeedActivity

|Layout
|activity_rssfeed

|===
	
	
=== Create layout files for the fragments
		
Create a new layout file called _fragment_rssitem_detail.xml_ in the _res/layout/_ folder.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/fragment_rssitem_detail.xml[]
----

NOTE: The id must be correct, the fragment uses this to search for the `TextView`.
		
Create a new layout file called _fragment_rsslist_overview.xml_. 

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/fragment_rsslist_overview.xml[]
----

NOTE: Also here, the id must be correct.
		
=== Create fragment classes
		
Create the follows classes which are used as fragments.
Start with the `DetailFragment` class.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/DetailFragment.java[]
----	
		

		
Create the `MyListFragment` class. 
Despite its name it will not display a list of items. 
Instead it will just have a button which allow to send the current time to the details fragment.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/MyListFragment.java[]
----		
		
		
=== Change the main layout file
		
Change the existing _activity_rssfeed.xml_ file.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/fragments/activity_rssfeed.xml[]
----	
		
=== RssfeedActivity
		
Change the `RssfeedActivity` class so that it can act as call back for the list fragment and update the detailed fragment.

[source,java]
----
include::res/fragments/RssfeedActivity.java[]
----	

NOTE: The tools: tag  is optional. It points to a layout to that the preview in Android Studio can display the fragment.

=== Verify that the application works as expected
		
Start your application.
Both fragments should be displayed both in landscape and portrait mode. 
You can use the emulator controls to change the orientation of the emulator.
If you press the button in  the `ListFragment`, the `DetailFragment` gets updated.
