== Fragments

=== What are single-pane or multi-pane layouts?
(((Single-pane layout)))
(((Multi-pane layout)))


Android devices exists in a variety of screen sizes and densities.

A _panel_ or _pane_ represents a part of the user interface. 
The term pane is a general term used to describe the concept that multiple views are combined into one compound view depending on the actual available space.

If not enough space is available only one panel is shown. 
This is typically called a _single-pane_ layout.

If more space is available, multiple panels can be shown.

=== What are fragments?
(((Fragments)))

A _fragment_ is an independent Android component which can be used by an activity.
A fragment encapsulates functionality so that it is easier to reuse within activities and layouts.

A fragment runs in the context of an activity, but has its own life cycle and typically its own user interface.
It is also possible to define fragments without an user interface, i.e., headless fragments.


=== Fragments and Context access

Fragments don't subclass the `Context` class. 
Therefore you have to use the `getActivity()` method to get the parent activity.

=== Advantages of using fragments

Fragments simplify the reuse of components in different layouts and their logic.
You can easily build single-pane layouts for handsets (phones) and multi-pane layouts for tablets.
You can also use fragments also to support different layout for landscape and portrait orientation on a smartphone.

As it is possible to dynamically add and remove fragments from an activity. 
The usage of fragments allows to design very flexible user interfaces.

The typical example is a list of items in an activity. 
On a tablet you see the details immediately on the same screen on the right hand side if you click on item. 
On a smartphone you jump to a new detail screen.
This is depicted in the following graphic.

The following discussion will assume that you have two fragments (main and detail), but you can also have more. 
We will also have one main activity and one detailed activity. 
On a tablet the main activity contains both fragments in its layout, on a handheld it only contains the main fragment.


The following screenshots demonstrates this usage.

=== How to support different screensizes with fragments 

It is possible to define in the layout file of an activity that it contains fragments (static definition).
You can also modify the fragments of an activity at runtime (dynamic definition).


To display different fragments in your activities based on the actual
available space you can:

* Use one activity, which displays two fragments
for tablets
and
on
handset devices. In this case change at runtime the fragments
displayed by the
activity whenever necessary. In this scenario you
typically define instances of the
`FrameLayout`
class as placeholder in your layout and add the fragments at
runtime to them.

* Use separate activities to host each fragment on a handset.
For example, when the tablet UI uses two fragments
in an activity,
use the same activity for handsets, but supply an
alternative
layout that includes just one fragment. If
the
detailed fragment is
there, the main
activity tells the fragment that
it should update
itself. If the
detail
fragment is not available, the
main activity
starts the detailed
activity.

Which option to select depends on the use case, typical the
dynamic contribution is more flexible bit a bit harder to implement.
