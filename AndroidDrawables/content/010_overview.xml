	<title>What are Drawables?
	
		A
		_Drawable_
		resource is a general concept for a graphic which can
		be drawn. The
		simplest case is a graphical file (bitmap), which would be represented
		in Android
		via a
		`BitmapDrawable`
		class.
	

	
		Every Drawable is stored as individual files in one of the
		_res/drawable_
		folders. Typically you would store bitmaps for different resolutions
		in the
		_-mdpi_
		,
		_-hdpi_
		,
		_-xhdpi_
		,
		_-xxhdpi_
		subfolders of
		_res/drawable_
		. The ADT project creation wizard
		creates these
		folders by default. If
		these bitmaps are provided in different folder, the Android system
		selects the correct one automatically based on the device
		configuration.
	

	
		If you do not
		provide bitmaps for all supported resolutions, the
		Android system
		scales
		the closest fit up or down. This is typically
		undesired as the bitmap might get blury.
	
	In addition to graphical files, Android supports XML drawables
		and 9-patch graphics. XML drawables are used to describe shapes
		(color, border, gradient), state, transitions and more.
	
	
		9-patch graphics are used to define which part of a graphic
		should be
		stretched if the
		view which uses this graphic is larger than
		the graphic.
	
	
		Drawables can also be written in Java code. Every object which
		implements
		`Drawable`
		can be used as a
		`Drawable in code.`
