== Vector drawables
	
Android 5.0 includes the possibility to define vector drawables,
similar to svg files but with a limited scope. The
following listing
demonstrates its usage in the
_vectordrawable.xml_
file. Using vector drawables has the advantages that this drawables
automatically scale to the density of the device.

Android 5.0 contains also the
`AnimatedVectorDrawable`
which allows to combine vector drawables with animations. See

for several examples.
	
Vector drawbles are also available for older platform via the support library as
`VectorDrawableCompat`
.
