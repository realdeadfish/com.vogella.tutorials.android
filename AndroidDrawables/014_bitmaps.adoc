== Loading Bitmaps and Drawables

Android allows you to use the
`Bitmap`
class for working with bitmaps. This section explain how to create
`Bitmap`
objects via Java code and how to convert
`Bitmap`
into
`Drawable`
objects and vice versa.

If required you can
load any accessible
bitmap file
in your code and
convert them into
`Drawables`
objects.

The following example code shows how to create an
`Bitmap`
object for the
_assets_
folder and assign it to an
`ImageView`
.

[source,java]
----
include::res/bitmap/load.java[]
----

You can also access the Drawables
from your
_res/drawable_
folder as
`Bitmap`
objects in your source code. The following code demonstrates that.

[source,java]
----
include::res/bitmap/loaddirect.java[]
----

You can create a scale bitmap based on a new weight and
height
definition in pixel.

[source,java]
----
include::res/bitmap/scale.java[]

To convert a
`Bitmap`
object
into a
`Drawable`
you can use the following code.

[source,java]
----
include::res/bitmap/convert.java[]
