== 9 Patch Drawables
	
_9 Patch drawables_
are
_Drawables_
which have a one pixel additional border. On the top and
left you
define the area which should be scaled if the
_Drawable_
is to small for the
view. This is the stretch area.

On the right and bottom side you define the area where a text should
be
placed
if this
`Drawable`
is used on a
view
which can write text on it, e.g. a Button.
	
The ADT supplies the
`draw9patch`
program in the
_android-sdk/tools_
installation folder, which makes it easy to
create
_9 Patch drawables_
.
