== Telnet to your Android device
	
Alternatively to adb you can also use telnet to connect to the
device.
This allows you to simulate certain things, e.g. incoming
call, change
the network connectivity, set your current geocodes, etc.
Use "telnet
localhost 5554" to connect to your simulated
device. To
exit the console
session, use the
`quit`
or
`exit`
command.
	
For example to change the power settings of your phone, to
receive an sms and to get an incoming call make the following.
