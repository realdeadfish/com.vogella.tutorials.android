	<title>Android views - UI Widgets
	
		A
		_view_
		in Android represents a widget, e.g., a button, or a layout manager.
		The Android SDK provides standard
		views
		(widgets), e.g., via the
		`Button`
		,
		`TextView`
		,
		`EditText`
		classes.
		It also includes complex widgets, for example,
		`ListView`
		.
	

	
		All
		views
		in Android
		extend the
		`android.view.View`
		class. This class is relatively large (more than 18 000 lines of
		code) and provides a lot of base functionality for subclasses.
	

	
		The main packages for views are part of the
		`android.view`
		namespace
		for all the base classes and
		`android.widget`
		for the default widgets of the Android platform.
