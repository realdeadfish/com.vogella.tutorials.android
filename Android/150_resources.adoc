== Resources
=== Resource files
(((Resource files)))
(((Resource qualifiers)))
		
Android allows you to create static resources like images and XML configuration files. This allows you to keep
these resources separate
from the source code of your Android application.
		
		
Resource files must be placed in the _/res_ directory of your application in a predefined sub-folder. 
The specific sub-folder depends
on type of resource which is
stored. You
can
also append additional
qualifiers to the folder
name to
indicate
that
the related resources
should be used
for
special
configurations. This are called
_resource qualifiers_
.
For
example, you can
specify
that layout file is only
valid for
a
certain
screen
size.

		
The
following table gives
an overview of the supported resources
and
their
standard folder
prefixes.


.Resources
[cols="1,1,4"]
|===
|Resource |Folder |Description

|Drawables
|_/res/drawables_
|Images (e.g., png or jpeg files)or vector drawables or XML files   which scale automatically with the density of the Android device

|Simple Values
|_/res/values_
|Used to define strings, colors, dimensions, styles and
		static
		arrays of strings or integers via XML files. By
		convention each
		type is
		stored
		in a separate file, e.g., strings are defined in
		the
		_res/values/strings.xml_
		file.
		
|Layouts
|_/res/layout_
|XML files with layout descriptions are used to define the user interface for activities and fragments.

|Styles and themes
|_/res/values_
|Files which define the appearance of your Android application.

|Animations
|_/res/animator_
|Defines animations in XML for the animation API which allows to animate arbitrary properties of objects over time.

|Raw data
|_/res/raw_
|Arbitrary files saved in their raw form. You access them via an `InputStream` object.

|Menus
|_/res/menu_
|Defines the actions which can be used in the toolbar of the application.

=== Example: Defining strings, string arrays, colors and dimensions
		
For example, the following _values.xml_ file in the _/res/values_ folder  defines a few String constants, a String array, a color and a
dimension.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/resources/values.xml[]
----

=== Resource files and R.java

		
Every relevant resource in the
_res_
folder, gets an ID assigned by the Android build system.
Android generates
_gen_
a
_R.java_
file
which contains the generated
values. These
references are static
integer
values.
		

		
If you
add a new
resource file, the corresponding
reference is
automatically
created in a
_R.java_
file.
Manual changes in the
_R.java_
file are not
necessary and will be overwritten
by the
tooling.
The Android
system
provides
methods to access the
corresponding
resource files
via these IDs.
		
		
For
example, to
access a
String with the
`R.string.yourString`
ID in your source code,
you would use the
`getString(R.string.yourString)`
method defined on the
`Context`
class.
		
=== Layout files
		
Android activities define their user interface with
views
(widgets) and
fragments.
This user interface
can be
defined via
XML
layout
resource
files in the
<filename class="filename">/res/layout_
folder or via Java code. You
can
also
mix
both approaches.
		
		
Defining layouts via
XML layout files
is the
preferred way.
This
separates the programming logic
from the layout
definition. It
also
allows the definition of different layouts
for different
devices.
		

		
A layout resource file is referred to as
_layout_
. A layout
specifies the
`ViewGroups`
,
`Views`
,
their
relationship and
their attributes via an XML representation.
		
The following code is an example for a simple layout file.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/layout/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
A layout is assigned to an activity via the `setContentView()` method calls, as demonstrated in the following example code.

[source,java]
---- 
include::res/layout/MainActivity.java[]
----

=== Performance considerations with layouts
Calculating the layout and drawing the views is a resource intensive operation. 
You should use the simplest layout possible to achieve good performance.
For example, you should avoid nesting layout
managers
too deeply or avoid using
complex layout managers in case a
simple layout manager is sufficient.
		
	
=== Good practices for resources IDs
(((Resource ID,Good practices)))
		
If a view needs to be accessed via Java or XML code, you have to give the view a unique ID via the `android:id` attribute. 
To assign a new
ID to a view
use the
`android:id`
attribute of the corresponding element in the layout file.

		

		
The Android SDK uses the
_camelCase_
notation
for most of its IDs, e.g.,
`buttonRefresh`
. It is good practice to follow this approach.
		
		
The
following shows an example in which a button
gets the
`button1`
ID assigned via the
`android:id="@+id/button1"`
parameter.
By conversion this statement
creates a new ID if necessary in the
`R.java`
file and assigns the defined ID
to the corresponding
view.
		

[source,xml]
----
include::res/snippets/id.txt[]
----

		
It is good practice to
define IDs in one central configuration file. This is typically called
_ids.xml_
and placed
in the
_/res/values_
folder. This allows you to use the predefined ID in your layout file. If you want to define the id in a separate
file, you first
need to remove the @+id entries in your layout
files, otherwise you
get an error messages that these
files have already been created. The following listing shows
an example for such
a file.
		
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/ids/ids.xml[]
----
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/ids/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
[NOTE]
====
While the above is good practice for real projects, the tutorials of this $book avoid the usage of a separate id file as this setup is time consuming.
====

=== System resources
		
Android also provides resources. 
These are called _system resources_. 
System resources are distinguished from local resources by the `android` namespace prefix. 
For example, `android.R.string.cancel` defines the platform string for a cancel operation.
