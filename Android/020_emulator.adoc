		<title>Android emulator and Android Virtual Device
		
			The Android tooling contains an Android device emulator. This
			emulator
			can
			be
			used to run an
			_Android Virtual Device_
			(AVD), which
			emulates a real Android phone.
		

		
			AVDs allow
			you to test your
			Android
			applications on different
			Android
			versions and
			configurations without
			access to the
			real hardware.
			Even if you have a
			real
			Android device available, you
			should get
			familiar with the
			creation and
			usage of
			AVDs. Virtual devices give you
			the possibility
			to test
			your
			application for selected Android versions
			and a specific
			configurations.
		

		
			During the creation of your AVD you define the configuration for
			the virtual device. This includes, for
			example,
			the resolution, the
			Android API version and the
			density of your display.
		
		
			You can
			define multiple AVDs with
			different
			configurations
			and start
			them in parallel. This allows you to test
			different device
			configurations at once.
		

		<note>
			If you stop and AVD during startup
				process the AVD might get
				corrupted. The first start may take up
				to 10 minutes
				on an older
				machine.
				On a modern machine it typically takes 1-3 minutes for a new
				AVD to
				start.
			
		</note>

		After the AVD has started, you can control the GUI with
			the
			mouse.
			The
			emulator also provides access to the phone
			buttons via a
			menu on
			the
			right side of the emulator.
		
		Once started,
			don't stop the AVD during your development. If you
			change your
			application and want to test a new
			version, you simply
			re-deploy
			your
			application
			on the AVD.

			Android applications must be signed before they can get
			installed
			on an
			Android device. During development Eclipse signs
			your
			application
			automatically with a self-signed certificate called the
			_debug key_
			.
		
		
			This debug certificate has an expiration date of 365 days from
			its creation date. When
			the certificate expires,
			you will get a build
			error that the certificate has been expired.
		
		
			To fix this
			problem, delete the
			<filename>debug.keystore</filename>
			file. The
			default
			storage
			location is in
			<filename>~/.android/</filename>
			on OS X and Linux,
			in
			<filename>C:\Documents andSettings\[username]\.android\</filename>
			on Windows XP, and in
			<filename>C:\Users\[username]]\.android\</filename>
			on Windows Vista and Windows 7.
		
		The next time you
			build, the build tools will regenerate a new
			keystore and debug key.

		<title>Google vs. Android AVD

		
			During the creation of an AVD you decide if
			you want to create an
			Android
			device or a
			Google device.
		
		
			An AVD created for
			Android contains the programs from the
			_Android Open Source Project_
			.
			An AVD created for the Google API's contains additional Google
			specific code.
		
		AVDs created for the
			Google API allow you to test applications
			which use Google Play services, e.g., the new
			Google maps API or the
			new
			location services.

		<title>Speed optimization with GPU rendering
		
			During the creation of an emulator you can choose if you either want
			_Snapshot_
			or
			_Use Host GPU_
			enabled.

		
		<note>
			The dialog implies that you can select both options, but if you
				do, you get an error message that these options
				can not be selected
				together.
			
		</note>

		
			If you select the
			_Snapshot_
			option, the second time you start the device it is started very fast,
			because the AVD stores its state if you close
			it. If you select
			_Use Host GPU_
			the AVD uses the graphics card of your host computer directly which
			makes the
			rendering on the emulated device much
			faster.

	<section id="emulator_intel">
		<title>Speed optimization with the Intel system image
		It is possible to run an AVD with an image based on the ARM CPU
			architecture or based on the Intel CPI
			architecture.
		
		An Android virtual device which uses the Intel system image is
			much faster in
			execution on Intel / AMD hardware
			compared to the ARM
			based system image. This is because the emulator
			does not need to
			translate the ARM CPU instructions
			to the Intel / AMD
			CPU on your
			computer.
		
		
			The Intel image for an API can be installed via the Android SDK Manager. In Android Studio this happens
			automatically if you create an device. If is possible to
			configure this via the package details.

			</mediaobject>
		

		<note>
			An Intel image is not available for all API levels.
		</note>
		
			At the time of this writing your also need to download and
			install
			extra drivers for MS windows.

			</mediaobject>
		


		
			After the download you find the driver
			in your Android installation
			directory in the
			<filename>extras/intel</filename>
			folder. You need to install the drivers by running starting the
			.exe
			file.
			This additional installation step is required on Window to
			accelerate the
			Intel emulator. Only downloading the
			driver via the
			Android does not make a
			difference.
		

		After the download you can create a new AVD based on the Intel
			emulator. The emulator does not start faster but
			is way faster during
			the execution of your Android application.
		
		<tip>
			
				Linux requires a more complex setup. For a detailed installation
				description see the
				<ulink url="https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager"> Intel emulator installation guide
				</ulink>
				which also includes detailed instructions for Windows.

		<title>Genymotion as alternative emulator
		
			There are alternatives to the default Android emulator available.
			For
			example, the

		<title>Using a real Android device for testing
		
			Turn on
			_USB Debugging_
			on your device in the settings. Select
			<menuchoice>
				<guimenu>Settings</guimenu>
				<guisubmenu>Development Options</guisubmenu>
			</menuchoice>
			, then enable the
			_USB-Debugging_
			option.
		
		
			You may
			also need to install the driver for
			your mobile phone.
			Linux and Mac OS usually work out of the box while
			Windows
			typically
			requires the installation of a driver.
		
		
			For details on the driver installation on Windows
			please see
			<ulink url="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html">Google guide for device deployment</ulink>
			.
		
		<note>
			The minimum Android version of your Android application needs
				to fit to the Android version on your device.
			
		</note>
		 If you have several devices connected to your computer, you can
			select which one should be
			used. If only one
			device is connected, the
			application is automatically deployed on this device.
