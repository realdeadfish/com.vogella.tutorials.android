			application to your device. You can deploy the application via USB in

	<section id="deployondevice_uses-feature">
		<title>Defining software and hardware requirements for the application
		
		
			The application can define via a <![CDATA[<uses-feature> ]]>
			declaration in the manifest file define which hardware of software
			features is requires. Via the
			`android:required`
			property the application can define if such a feature is required for
			the application to work correctly (true) or if
			application prefers to
			use the feature if present on the device, but
			that it is designed to
			function without the specified feature, if
			necessary.
		
		Examples for such definitions are the presence of a certain
			hardware sensor or the availability of a camera.
		
			For an overview of the available restrictions see

	<section id="deployondevice_export">
		<title>Signing your application for the release
		Android applications must be signed before they can get
			installed
			on an Android device. During development Eclipse signs your
			application automatically with a debug key.
		
		To install the Android application via another channel you need
			to sign the Android apk with a self-created signature key.
		
		 Please note that you need to use the same signature key in
			Google Play (Google Market) to update your application. If you lose
			the key, you will NOT be able to update your application ever again.
		
		Make sure to backup your key.

		<title>Via external sources
		
			Android also allows to install applications directly. Just click
			on a
			link which points to an
			_.apk_
			file, e.g., in an email attachment
			or on a webpage. Android will
			prompt you if you want to install this
			application.
		
		This requires a setting on the Android device which allows the
			installation of non-market application. Typically this setting can
			be
			found under the "Security" settings.

	<section id="deployondevice_play">
		<title>Google Play (Market)
		
			Google Play requires a one time fee, currently 25 Dollar. After
			that
			the developer can directly upload his application and the required
			icons, under
			<ulink url="https://play.google.com/apps/publish">Google Play Publishing</ulink>
			.
		
		
			Google performs some automatic scanning of applications, but no
			approval process is in place. All application, which do not contain
			malware, will be published. Usually a few minutes after upload,
			the
			application is
			available.
