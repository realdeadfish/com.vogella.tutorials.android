== Using Android Studio

[WARNING]
====
Android Studio menus entries are dynamic calculated based on your current selection.
Unfortunately this feature seems currently a bit buggy. 
If you do not see a certain menu entry, try selecting the _app_ entry again.

=== Creating a new layout file

To create a new layout file, select your project, right click on it and select menu:File[New>Android resource file]. 
Choose the the _Layout_ option to create a layout file.

		
The easiest way to create a new resource file, e.g., a layout file, is the context menu on the corresponding folder.
To create a new folder, see <<androidstudio_creatingresourcefolder>>.
This is demonstrates for the creation of a new layout file in the following screenshot.

NOTE: If you want to create a new layout file for a certain qualifier, you can select it in the creation dialog.

[[androidstudio_creatingresourcefile]]
=== Creating a new resource file

Similar to the above described creation of layout file, you can create other resources, by changing the selection in the displayed dialog.

[[androidstudio_creatingresourcefolder]]
=== Creating a new resource folder
		
If a resource folder is missing, you have to create it. 
This is demonstrated by the following screenshots for the creation of the _layout-port_folder.

[[androidstudio_workingonlayoutfiles]]
=== Working on layout files
		
Android Studio offers a visual and a text editor for editing your layout files. The
easiest way to add new widgets to
an existing layout file is to find
these
elements in the
_Palette_
and drag and
drop
them into your layout.
In the visual design
mode
you can remove a
view by
right-clicking it and by
selecting the
_Delete_
entry for the context menu.
		
Android Studio replaces placeholder values with the
real values. This makes it sometimes harder to compare
files.
Double-click on the value in this case to see the placeholder value.

[[androidstudio_createimage]]
=== Add images to your project

		
From the menu of Android Studio, select menu:File[New>Vector Assert] to create a new vector drawable.
The creation process is demonstrated for the _ic_tethering_ icon.

[[androidstudio_createmenu]]
=== Add a new menu resource
		
If not yet present, create a new directory called _menu_.

image::menu_resources10.png[Create menu directory,pdfwidth=60%]
		
Create a new XML resource called _mainmenu.xml_ for your menu.

Afterwards you can manually edit the generated file.

[[androidstudio_viewinglogentries]]
=== See the log statements of your Android application
		
Use the _Android_ view (Shortcut: kbd:[Alt+6]) to see the log statements in Android Studio.

		
== Java programming tasks

=== Generating Getter/setting, toString, etc.
		
Select the menu:Code[Generate...] menu entry to generate getter, setter, constructors, etc.
		
=== Rename a resource
		
To rename a resource, e.g., a Java file, select menu:Refactor[Rename...] from the context menu of the corresponding resource or use the kbd:[Shift+F6] shortcut.


[[androidstudio_sourceupdate]]
=== Using Java 8 in Android applications
        
The latest Gradle plug-in supports the usage of Java 8, with some restrictions. 
As of Android Gingebread (API 9) and above you can use:

* Lambda expressions
* java.util.function
        
        
As of Android N you can use:

* Default and static interface methods
* Repeatable annotations
* Streams
* Reflection APIs

To enable Java 8 in your project use the following settings. Important is the jackOptions part and the compileOptions.
        

[source,java]
----
android {
  ...
  defaultConfig {
    ...
    jackOptions {
      enabled true
    }
  }
  compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
  }
}
----


=== Using live template in your Java code
	
Android studio provides templates for typical task in Java and Android. 
The following list contains a few of the most useful:

* Toast - Creates a Toast
* fbc - findViewById with cast
* const - Defines a constant
*	
	
Use menu:File[Settings>Editor>Live Templates] to see the full list.
