== Custom Android library modules

=== Using custom library modules 
		
If an Android application project uses an Android
library module, the
Android
development tools include the code and resources from the
library
project into the
build result of the Android project. This
means, that
the components, code and resources of
the
library project
are
compiled
and packaged into the
_.apk_
file
of the
compiled application.
		
Therefore a
library module
can be
considered to
be a compile-time
artifact. An Android library module can contain
Java
classes,
Android
components and
resources.
Only assets
are not supported.
		
To create a library project, set the
`Mark this project as library`
flag in the Android project generation wizard.
		
The library project must declare all its components, e.g.,
_activities_
,
_service_
, etc. via the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file. The application
which uses the library must also declare all the
used components via
the
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.

=== Priorities for conflicting resources
		
The Android development tools merges the resources of a library
project with
the resources of the application project.
In the case that
a resource's ID is defined several times, the tools
select the
resource
from the application, or the library with highest
priority,
and discard
the other resource.
