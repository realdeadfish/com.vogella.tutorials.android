== Exercise: Create an Android library module

=== Target of this exercise
		
Our library project will contain the data model and a method to get the number of instances. 
The library provides access to (fake) RSS data. 
An _RSS_ document is an XML file which can be used to publish blog entries and news. 

=== Create library module
		
For Android Studio each library is a module. To create a new library
module in Android Studio, select
menu:File[New Module]
and select
`Android Library`.

Use
_com.example.android.rssfeedlibrary_
as module name and
_Rssfeed Library_
as library name.

If prompted for a template select that no activity should be created. 
As a result Android Studio shows another module.

=== Create the model class
		
Create an
`RssItem`
class which can store data of an RSS entry.
		
Generate the getters and setter, the constructor and a
`toString()`
method. The result should look like the following class:
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/RssItem.java[]
----		
	
=== Create instances
		
Create a new class called
`RssFeedProvider`
with a static method to return a list of
`RssItem`
objects. This method does currently only return
test data.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/RssFeedProvider.java[]
----		
	
=== Define dependency to the library project
		
		
To use the library add it as a dependency in your project select
menu:File[Project Structure]. 
Select the
_app_
entry. Switch to the
`Dependencies`
tab and select
`Module dependencies`
via the + sign.

=== Use library project to update detailed fragments
		
Use the static method of
`RssFeedProvider`
to get the list of
`RssItem`
objects and display the number in your
`DetailFragment`
instead of current system time.
		
To send the new data, change the `updateDetail` method in your `MyListFragment` class.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/net/MyListFragment.java[]
----		

<1> Updated method
	
=== Validate implementation
		
Start your application and ensure that the `toString` value of the list of RssItems is displayed in the detailed fragment.

NOTE: The list is currently generated randomly every time you press the button.
