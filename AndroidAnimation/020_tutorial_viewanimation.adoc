== Tutorial: View Animation

This tutorial demonstrates the usage of the
Properties animation
API.
	
Create
a
new Android project called
_com.vogella.android.animation.views_
with
the
_activity_
called
_AnimationExampleActivity_. The layout file should be called 
_main.xml_. Change this file 
to the
following code.
	
[source,xml]
----
include::res/ani/main.xml[]
----	

Create the following menu resource.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/ani/mymenu.xml[]
----	
	
Change your
_activity_
to the following.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ani/AnimationExampleActivity.java[]
----	
	
Create a new
_activity_
called
_HitActivity_
.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/ani/HitActivity.java[]
----	
	
If you run this example and press the different Buttons, the animation
should start. Via the ActionBar you can navigate to your other
_activity_
.
