== Android Animations

=== Using animations
		
Android 3.0 introduced the
_Properties Animation API_
which allow to change object properties over a predefined
time
interval.
		
The API allows to define for arbitrary object
properties a start and
end value and apply a time-based change to
this attribute. This API
can be applied on any Java object not only on
`Views`.
		
=== Animator and AnimatorListener
		
The superclass of the animation API is the
`Animator`
class. Typically the
`ObjectAnimator`
class is used to modify the attributes of an object.
		
You can also add an
`AnimatorListener`
class to your
`Animator`
class. This listener is called in the different phases of the
animation. You can use this listener to perform actions before or
after a certain animation, e.g. add or remove a
`View`
from a
`ViewGroup`
.
		
=== ViewPropertyAnimator
		
The
`ViewPropertyAnimator`
class introduced in Android 3.1 provides a simpler access to typical
animations which are performed on
views.
		
The
`animate()`
method on a
view
returns the
`ViewPropertyAnimator`
object. This object allows
to perform simultaneous animations. It
has a
fluent API and allows
setting
the duration of the animation.
		
The target of
`ViewPropertyAnimator`
is to provide a very simple API for typical animations.
		
The following code shows an example of the usage of this method.

----
include::res/viewproperty/Test.java[]
----
		
For performance optimization you can also let
`ViewPropertyAnimator`
use a hardware layout.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/viewproperty/TestHardware.java[]
----		
		
You can also directly define a
`Runnable`
to be executed at the start and the end of the animation.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/viewproperty/TestLayoutActions.java[]

The
`setInterpolator()`
allows to define an object of type
`TimeInterpolator`
which defines the change of the value over time. The standard is
linear. The Android platform
defines a few default ones as for example
`AccelerateDecelerateInterpolator`
where the rate of change starts and ends slowly but accelerates
through the middle.
		
Via the
`setEvaluator`
method you can set an object of type
`TypeEvaluator`
which allow you to create animations on arbitrary property
types, by
providing custom evaluators for types that
are not automatically
understood and used by the animation system.
		
=== Layout animations
		
The
`LayoutTransition`
class allows setting animations on a layout container and a change on
the
view hierarchy
of this container will be animated.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/layout/LayoutAnimations.java[]
----		
	
=== Animations for Activity transition
		
Animations can be applied to
`Views`
but it is also possible to apply them on the transition between
activities.
		
The
`ActivityOptions`
class
allows defining defaults or customer animations.
