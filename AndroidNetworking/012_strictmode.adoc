== Good practices for network access under Android

Within an Android application you should avoid performing long
running
operations on the user interface thread. This includes file and
network
access.

As of Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) the system is configured
to crash with a
`NetworkOnMainThreadException`
exception, if network is accessed in the user interface thread.

A typical setup for performing network access in a productive
Android application is using a service. While it is possible to do
network access from an activity or a fragment, using a service typical
leads to a better overall design because you code in the activity
becomes simpler.

[TIP]
====
For testing you can allow network access in the main thread via the
following snippet. at the beginning of your
`onCreate()`
method of your
_activity_
.
