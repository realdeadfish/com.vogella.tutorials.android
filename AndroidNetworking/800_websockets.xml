	<title>Web Sockets

	
		Web Sockets are a standard based on HTTP for asynchronous
		message-based
		communication between a client and a server. To start a
		web socket communication, you create a HTTP GET request with a special
		HTTP headers. If the server accepts this request, the client and the
		server can send each other messages.
	
	Messages can be text or binary data and should be relatively
		small, as the web socket protocol is intended to be used with small
		payloads in the data.
	
	It is good practice to use JSON as data format for the messages.
	
	
		You find a Java library for both the server and the client under
		http://java-websocket.org/[]
		.
