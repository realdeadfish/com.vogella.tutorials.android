== Strings and translations

=== Strings and translations
		
You can also use resource selectors for your _values_ folder with contains, for example, your string values. 
Use the _values-qualifier_ folder for this.
		
For example, to provide English and German text resources, use the _values-en_ and _values-de_ folder.
		
=== Plurals
		
Android supports Plurals. 
Plurals are XML based resources which allow to handle different quantities. 
This way you can select the right text based on the quantity. 
In your XML file you specify values for the quantities “zero”, “one”, “two”, “many”, “few”, “many”, “other” and in your code you use the `getQuantityString()` method to get the correct value. 
You can also format strings. 
If now Strings are formated then you pass in the plural resources and the number. 
If Objects should be used for formating you pass them as additional parameters.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/plurals/string.xml[]
----
		
For example the following will define a plural. 
This file needs to be in the “res/values” directory and in this example it is called “plurals”.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/plurals/Test.java[]
----

Note that the selection is made based on grammatical necessity. 
A string for zero in English will be ignored even if the quantity is 0, because 0 isn’t grammatically different from 2, or any other number except 1 (“no tutorial”, “one tutorial”, “two tutorials”, and so on).
		
=== Using Google translate
		
You can either translate your String manually (either yourself or a paid organization) or use a machine translation.
		
White a machine based translation is not optional it might be a good starting point or the only option if the budget for the application is limited.
http://translate.google.com/toolkit[Google Translate] provides free machine translation with the option to hire professionals for checks.
		
TIP: The tool offer free suggestions but it first offers you (at the moment) a paid translation.
