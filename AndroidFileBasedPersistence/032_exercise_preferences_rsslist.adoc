Add entries to this file similar to the following listing. 

[source,xml]

include::res/preferences/mypreferences.xml[]
----
	
=== Create settings activity

Create the class
`SettingsActivity`
which extends
`PreferenceActivity`
. This
activity
loads the
preference
file and allows the user to change
the values.

[source,java]
----
include::res/preferences/SettingsActivity.java[]
----

Register this class as an activity in your
_AndroidManifest.xml_
file.

=== Connect your settings activity

Open the preference
activity via the
`onOptionsItemSelected()`
method as demonstrated in the following listing.

[source,java]
----
include::res/preferences/OverviewActivity2.java[]
----
	
=== Use the preference value to load the RSS feed

To make use of our new preference activity and the preference
values
we adjust the
`MyListFragment`
class. The following code snippet
demonstrates how you can access the
preference value in a method which triggers an
`AsyncTask`
to load the feed from the Internet.

[source,java]
----
include::res/preferences/UpdateListContent.java[]
----

=== Validating

Run your application. Select from your action bar the
`Settings`
action.
You should be able to enter a URL. If you press the back
button and press the refresh button, ensure that the
value of the url
preference is used in your activity.

=== Optional: Show the current value in the settings

The following code snippet demonstrates how to show the current
value in the preference screen.
