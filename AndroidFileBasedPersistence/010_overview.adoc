== File based persistence

=== Methods of local data persistence

Android
allows to persists application data via the file system. For
each application the Android system creates a
<filename class="diretory">data/data/[application package]_
directory.

Android supports the following ways of storing data in the local file
system:

* Files - You can create and update files
* Preferences - Android allows you to save and retrieve persistent key-value pairs of primitive data type.
* SQLite database - instances of SQLite databases are also stored on the local file system.

Files
are saved in the
<filename class="diretory">files_
folder and
application
settings are
saved
as
XML files in the
<filename class="diretory">shared_prefs_
folder.

If your application creates an
SQLite database
this
database is
saved in
the
main application directory under the
<filename class="diretory">databases_
folder.

The following screenshot shows a file system which contains
file,
cache files and preferences.

Only the application can write into its application directory.
It can create additional sub-directories in this application
directory.
For these
sub-directories, the application can grant read or
write permissions
for other
applications.

=== Internal vs. external storage

Android has internal storage and external storage. External
storage is not private and may not always be available. If for
example the Android device is connected with a computer, the computer
may mount the external system via USB and that makes this external
storage not avaiable for Android applications.

=== Application on external storage

As of Android 8 SDK level it is possible to define that the
application
can or
should be placed on external storage. For this set
the
`android:installLocation`
to preferExternal or auto.

In this case certain application components may be stored on an
encrypted external mount point. Database and other private data will
still be stored in the internal storage system.
