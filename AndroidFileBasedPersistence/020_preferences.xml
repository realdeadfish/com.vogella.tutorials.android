		<title>Storing key-value pairs
		
			Android supports the usage of the
			_SharedPreferences_
			class
			for persisting key-value pairs (preferences)of primitive data
			types in the Android file system.
		
		
			The
			definition of these preferences can
			be done
			via an XML
			resource.
		
		
			The
			`PreferenceManager`
			class provides methods to get access to preferences stored in a
			certain file.
			The following code
			shows how to
			access
			preferences from a
			certain file
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/preferences/getPrefs.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		
		Preferences should be created private for the application. They can be accessed
			via all application components.
			Sharing data with other application
			with world readable or writable
			preference file is rarely used, as
			the external
			component would need to know the exact filename and
			location of the file.
		
		
			The default preferences are available from any component via the
			`PreferenceManager.getDefaultSharedPreferences(this)`
			method call.
			Preference value are accessed via the key and the instance of the
			`SharedPreferences`
			class, as demonstrated in the following listing.
		
		
			<programlisting>
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/preferences/getPrefsValue.txt" />
			</programlisting>
		

		
			To create or change preferences you have to call the
			`edit()`
			method on
			the
			`SharedPreferences`
			object. Once you have changed the value you have to call the
			`apply()`
			method
			to
			apply your asynchronously to the file system. The usage of
			the
			`commit()`
			method is discouraged, as it write the changes synchronously to the
			file system.

		<title>Preference Listener
		
			You can listen to changes in the preferences via the
			`registerOnSharedPreferenceChangeListener()`
			method on
			`SharedPreferences`
			.
		
		
			<programlisting language="java">
				<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" parse="text" href="./examples/listener/preference.java" />
			</programlisting>
		
		
			One watch out is that
			`SharedPreferences`
			keeps listeners in a
			`WeakHashMap`
			hence listener may be recycled if your code does not hold a reference
			to it.
