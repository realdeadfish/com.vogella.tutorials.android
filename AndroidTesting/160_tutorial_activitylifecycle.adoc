== Exercise: Life cycle test

[[tutorial_activitylifecycle_target]]
=== Target of this exercise

In this exercise the instrumentation test framework is demonstrated. 
For such test you would typically use higher level frameworks, like Espresso.


[[tutorial_activitylifecycle1]]
=== Create project which is tested

Create a new Android project called _com.vogella.android.test.simpleactivity_ with the activity called _MainActivity_.


Add a second activity called `SecondActivity` to your project.
This activity should use a layout with at least one `TextView`. 
The id of the `TextView` should be "resultText" and its text should be set to "Started".

Add an `EditText` field to the layout of the `MainActivity` class.

Add a button to the layout used by your `MainActivity` activity.
If this button is clicked, the second activity should be started.

Put the text `EditText` field as extra into the intent
using "text" as key. Also put the "http://www.vogella.com" String as extra into the intent and use the key "URL" for
this.

Here is some example code for the `MainActivity`.
