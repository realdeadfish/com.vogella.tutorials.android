[[service_testing]]
=== Service testing

To test a service you use the `ServiceTestRule` class from the Android Testing Support Library. The old `ServiceTestCase` is deprecated.

This rule provides a simplified mechanism to start and shutdown your service before and after your test. 
It guarantees that the service is successfully connected when starting (or binding to) a service. 
The service can be started (or bound) using one of the helper methods. 
It will automatically be stopped (or unbound) after the test completes and any methods annotated with @After are finished.

[WARNING]
====
This rule doesn't support IntentService because it's automatically destroyed after the `onHandleIntent` method.

The following listing is an example of testing a service.

[[provider_testing]]
=== Content provider testing

To test a content provider, you use the `ProviderTestCase2` class.
`ProviderTestCase2` automatically instantiates the provider under test and inserts an `IsolatedContext` object.
This context is isolated from the Android system, but still allows file and database access.
The usage of the `IsolatedContext` object ensures that your _provider_ test does not affect the real device.

`ProviderTestCase2` also provides access to a `MockContentResolver` via the `getMockContentResolver()` method.

You should test all operations of the provider and also what happens if the provider is called with an invalid URI or with an invalid projection.

[[loader_testing]]
=== Loader testing

To test a loader, you use the `LoaderTestCase`class. 
It is expected that a JUnit 4 rule will be provided in the future to replace this class.
