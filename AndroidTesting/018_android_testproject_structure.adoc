== Android project structure and test folder creation

[[androidtesting_projectstructure]]
=== Android project organization for tests

The preferred way of organizing Android tests is based on a convention. 
In your application project, you should use the following base folder structure for your code organization. 
This is also the structure the Android project wizard creates.

* `app/src/main/java`- for your source code of your main application build
* `app/src/test/java` - for any unit test which can run on the JVM
* `app/src/androidTest/java` - for any test which should run on an Android device


If you follow this conversion, then the Android build system can automatically run your tests on the correct target (JVM or Android device).
