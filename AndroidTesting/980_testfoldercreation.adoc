==	Test folder creation in Android Studio

The recent versions of Android Studio has added a test folder to its default project template. 
In case you are using a template which does not create a test folder, you have to create it manually. 
To create the test folder in Android Studio, switch to the _Project_ view, this shows you the directory structure of your project.

If not yet done, also add the JUnit dependency to your Gradle build file.

[source,gradle]
----
include::examples/unittests/simple.gradle[]
----

[WARNING]
====
The creation of the Java folder might add the new test directory as source file to your build.gradle file. 
If you have the following entry in your `app/build.gradle` file you need to REMOVE it. 
test should NOT be treated as normal source folder.

[source,java]
----
include::examples/unittests/wrongentry.txt[]
----
====


Afterwards you can add your unit test to this folder structure.
