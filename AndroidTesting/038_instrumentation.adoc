==	Writing Instrumentation tests to run on the Android device

[[androidtesting_instrumentation]]
=== Instrumentation tests

The Android testing API provides hooks into the Android component and application life cycle. 
These hooks are called the _instrumentation API_ and allow your tests to control the life cycle and user interaction events.

Under normal circumstances your application cannot control the life cycle events and the user drives the application.
For example, if Android creates your activity the `onCreate()` method is called. 
Or if the user presses a button your corresponding code is called. 
Via instrumentation you can control these events via your test code.
For example, your instrumentation test can start the activity.
Afterwards, it can call the `finish()` and restart the activity to test if the instance state of the activity is correctly restored.

Instrumented unit tests are unit tests that run on Android devices and emulators instead of running on the Java virtual machine. 
These tests have access to the real device and its resources and are useful to unit test functionality which cannot be easily mocked by mocking frameworks. 
An example is a test which validates a `Parcelable` implementation.

An instrumentation-based test class allows you to send key events (or touch events) to the application under test.

With user interface testing framework like Espresso, the developer rarely has to use the instrumentation API directly.


[[androidtesting_process]]
=== How the Android system executes tests

The `InstrumentationTestRunner` is the base test runner for Android tests. 
This test runner starts and loads the test methods. 
Via the instrumentation API it communicates with the Android system. 
If you start a test for an Android application, the Android system kills any process of the application under test and then loads a new instance. 
It does not start the application, this is the responsibility of the test methods. 
The test method controls the life cycle of the components of the application.

The test runner also calls the `onCreate()` method of the application and activity under test during its initialization.

[[mockingobjects]]
=== Mocking objects in Android

The mocking framework _Mockito_ can also be used for instrumentation tests.
This allows you to replace parts of the Android system which are not interesting for the test.
The Android framework provided in the past specialized mocking classes but these are not necessary anymore.


[[androidtesting_instrumentationtests_location]]
=== Location of instrumentation tests

As described in <<androidtesting_projectstructure>> the unit tests of an Android project should be located in the `app/src/androidTest/java` folder. 
See <<androidtesting_creatingtestfolders>> for the creation of such a test folder.

[[androidtesting_instrumentationtests_gradledependencies]]
=== Define dependencies and testInstrumentationRunner in the Gradle build file

To use JUnit tests for your Android application you need to add the dependency to JUnit to your Gradle build file. 
You also need to specify `android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner` as testInstrumentationRunner in the build file.

include::examples/instrumentedtests/simple.gradle[]

[[androidtesting_instrumentationtests_testrunner]]
=== Using the @RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)

It is also recommended annotating the test with the `@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)` annotation. 
AndroidJUnit4 extends JUnit4, so if you use pure Junit4 syntax and ActivityTestRule it is not required.
But you need it, if you want to run, i.e., Espresso tests with `ActivityTestRule` and JUnit4.

[[androidtesting_instrumentationtests_runtunittestsgradle]]
=== Run the unit tests from Gradle

Run your unit tests with the `gradlew connectedCheck` command.

[[androidtesting_instrumentationtests_runtunittestsas]]
=== Run the unit tests from Android Studio

Right-click on your test class in the _Project_ window and select _Run_.

[[androidtesting_instrumentationtests_testresults]]
=== Location of test reports

The test reports are created in the `app/build/reports/androidTests/connected/` directory. 
The `index.html` gives an overview and links to the individual test pages.

=== How to replace the application for instrumentation tests

You can replace the application class for the instrumentation tests by overriding the `AndroidJUnitRunner` and its `AndroidJUnitRunner` method.

[source,java]
----
package com.vogella.android.daggerjunitmockito;

import android.app.Application;


public class MyMockApplication extends Application {
    
    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
       // do something important for your tests here
    }
}
----

Test runner

[source,java]
----
package com.vogella.android.daggerjunitmockito;

import android.app.Application;
import android.content.Context;
import android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner;

public class MockTestRunner extends AndroidJUnitRunner {
  @Override
  public Application newApplication(ClassLoader cl, String className, Context context)
      throws InstantiationException, IllegalAccessException, ClassNotFoundException {
    return super.newApplication(cl, MyMockApplication.class.getName(), context);
  }
}

----

And you need to register this test runner in your build.gradle file.

[source,java]
----
android {
    /// more
        testInstrumentationRunner "com.vogella.android.daggerjunitmockito.MockTestRunner"
    }
    /// more
}
