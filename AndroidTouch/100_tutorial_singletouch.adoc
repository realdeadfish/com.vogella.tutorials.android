== Exercise: Custom view and touch events

=== Draw via touch
		
This exercise demonstrates the handling of (single) touch events
within a custom
view.
		
Create an Android project called
_com.vogella.android.touch.single_
with the
_activity_
called
_SingleTouchActivity_.
		
Create the following
`SingleTouchEventView`
class which implements a View which supports single touch.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/single/SingleTouchEventView.java[]
----		
		
Add this view to your
_activity_
.

[source,java]
----
include::res/single/SingleTouchActivity.java[]
----
		
If you run your application you will be able to draw on the
screen with your finger (or with the mouse in the emulator).
		
Change your coding so that you use a layout definition based on
XML. Hint: to use your own view in an XML layout definition you have
to
use the full-qualified class name (class including package
information).
		
=== Tracking
		
Add code to your drawing example so that the current position
of a
finger is marked via a circle. To draw a circle you can use the
`addCircle(x, y, 50, Path.Direction.CW)`
method call on a
`Path`
or use the canvas element directly.
		
Make sure that only the current position is highlighted
with a
circle. The circle should appears as soon as the
finger goes down and
vanish once the finger goes up.
		
The result should look like the following.
