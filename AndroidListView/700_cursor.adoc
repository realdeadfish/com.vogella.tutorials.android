== SimpleCursorAdapter
	
In case you work with a content provider or directly with the database
you can use the
`SimpleCursorAdapter`
to define the data for your
`ListView`
. The following will demonstrates how to access the Contacts
ContentProvider.
	
Create a new Android project called
"de.vogella.android.listactivity.cursor"
with the
_activity_
called
_MyListActivity_. Change
`MyListActivity`
to the following.
	
[source,java]
----
include::res/cursor/MyListActivity.java[]
----
	
Make sure you give your application the permission to read the
contacts. (Uses Permissions "android.permission.READ_CONTACTS" in
AndroidManifest.xml)
