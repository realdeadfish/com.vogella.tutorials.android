== Tutorial: How to display two items in a ListView

You can use the
`SimpleAdapter`
class to show the data of two elements. This class expects a Array of
Strings (
`from`
data) in which the fields of the input data are defined. It also
requires a Array of ints which defines the IDs of the widgets in the
layout for the row to which these fields are mapped.

The actual data is then a list of Maps. The Map defines for each
field in the from data a value.

 The following shows an example which reuses an predefined layout
from Android for the row.
