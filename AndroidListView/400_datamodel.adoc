=== Interaction between the model and Listview

Frequently you need to select items in your
`ListView`
. As the row of the
`ListView`
are getting recycled you cannot store the selection on the
`View`
level.

Selection is just one possible example but you can imange other
interaction between your row and model.

To persist the selection you have to update your data model with
the selected state.

To update the data model in your
`ListView`
you define your own
`Adapter`
class. In this adapter class you attach a listener to the
`View`
which is responsible for selecting the model element. If selected you
update the state in the model which you can add
as a tag to the View
to have access to it.

The following example demonstrates how to use standard Java
object
and
how to interact from the
`Views`
with the model.

=== Tutorial: Domain Model and list view rows interaction

Continue to use the
`de.vogella.android.listactivity`
project.

Create the following
`Model`
which hold the name and the information if this element is
currently
selected.

[source,java]
----
include::res/interactive/Model.java[]
----

Create the following new layout file called
_rowbuttonlayout.xml_
.

[source,xml]
----
include::res/interactive/rowbuttonlayout.xml[]
----

Create the following
`Adapter`
. This adapter adds a listener
on the
`Checkbox`
view
. If the checkbox
is selected the underlying data of
the model is
changed.
`Checkbox`
gets the corresponding model element
assigned via the
`getTag()`
method.

[source,java]
----
include::res/interactive/InteractiveArrayAdapter.java[]
----

Finally change your
activity
to the following.

[source,java]
----
include::res/interactive/MyList.java[]
----

 If you start your app you should be able to flag items. These
changes will be reflected in your model.
