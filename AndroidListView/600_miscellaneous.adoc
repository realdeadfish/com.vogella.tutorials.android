[[miscellaneous_headerfooter]]
=== Header and footer
		
You can of course put arbitrary
views
elements around your list view.
For
example you can define a layout with
two
text views
and a
list view
between them.
In this case the two text views will
always be
visible
above the list
(header) and the other will be
visible below
the
list. If you want
to display a list header or list footer
only at
the
see
the
beginning or end of
the list you can use the
`addHeaderView()`
method
or
`addFooterView()`
method on the
`ListView`
class.
