[[listview_selection]]
== Storing the selection of a view
	
By default a
`ListView`
has no selection mode active. You can activate
it via the
`setChoiceMode()`
method call. Pass
`ListView.CHOICE_MODE_MULTIPLE`
for multiple selections or
`ListView.CHOICE_MODE_SINGLE`
for single selections
to this method.
	
To get the selected items of a
`ListView`,
use the
`getCheckedItemPosition()`
for a single selection
method or
`listView.getCheckedItemPositions()`
for multiple selections.
. If you have stable ID, you could
also use the
`getCheckedItemIds()`
method to get the selected IDs.
	
Android already provides a default layout for this: the
`android.R.layout.simple_list_item_multiple_choice`
layout which contains a configured
`CheckedTextView`
view.
	
The following activities demonstrate how to use these selection
modes. If you use these modes, the
`ListView`
stores the selected values. It is not persisted in your data model.
