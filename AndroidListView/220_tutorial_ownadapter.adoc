== Tutorial: Implementing your customer adapter
		
The following uses
two images "no.png" and "ok.png". I placed it
in the
"res/drawable-mdpi" folder. You must create your own icons. In
case you do not find any icons just copy "icon.png" and use a drawing
program to
change
it a little bit.
		
Create the class
`MySimpleArrayAdapter`
which will serve as our adapter.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/simpleadapter/MySimpleArrayAdapter.java[]
----
		
To use this adapter, change the
_activity_
to
the following.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/simpleadapter/MyListActivity.java[]
----
		
If you run this example you should get a list with different
icons for the certain elements.
