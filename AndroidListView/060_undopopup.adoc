== Implementing undo for an action
[[listview_undoaction1]]
=== When should you offer an undo action?
		
It is good practice to allow the user to undo critical actions.
Such a critical action is, for example, the deletion of list items.
		
A proven
pattern to handle this undo option is to offer
a
selection
at the end of the
screen. This selection vanishes after a
predefined
time or once
the user continues to interact with the
application.
		
For example, the
Gmail application implements such a
behavior.

=== Example
		
The following description contains an example for implementing
an undo action. It uses an animation to phase out the
undo button
automatically out after a while.
		
For this example create a new project called
_com.vogella.android.userinterface.undo_
based on the
_BlankTemplate_
template.
		
Create the following layout for your
_activity_
. It uses a
`FrameLayout`
to show two different parts of the user interface. The button bar is
initially hidden. The button uses a drawable. Either add such a
drawable
to your project or remove the reference.
		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/undo/activity_main.xml[]
----
		
Change your
_activity_
so that it is similar to the following code. The project
wizard generated an `ActionBar` entry. This entry is
used in the following code. If in doubt, create your own `ActionBar`
entry.
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/undo/MainActivity.java[]
----
		
If you select the entry in the
_ActionBar_,
the button bar becomes visible for 5 seconds.
