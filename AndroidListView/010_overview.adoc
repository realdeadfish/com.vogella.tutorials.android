== Using lists in Android
	
The display of elements in a list is a very common pattern in
mobile
applications. The user sees a list of items and can scroll
through
them. Such an activity is depicted in the following picture.

Typically the user interacts with the list via the
toolbar, for example, via a button which refreshes the list. Individual list items can
be
selected. This selection can update
the
toolbar or
can
trigger a
detailed screen for the selection. The following graphic sketches
that. On the selection of a list item another activity is started.
