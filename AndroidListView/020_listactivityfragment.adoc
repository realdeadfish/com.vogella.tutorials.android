=== Default container for using ListView
		
			Android provides specialized fragment and activity classes to
			simplify list
			handling.
		
		
			The classes are the
			`ListActivity`
			class if you want to use lists in activities and the
			`ListFragment`
			class if you want to use lists in fragments.
		
		
			You do not have to assign a layout to these elements. If you do
			not define a layout, the activity or fragment contains a
			single
			`ListView`
			by default.
			`ListActivity`
			and
			`ListFragment`
			also allow you to override
			a
			`onListItemClick()`
			method for handling selection of list items.
		
		
			Both classes allow you to set the adapter to the default
			`ListView`
			via the
			`setListAdapter()`
			method.
		

		
			The following example code shows a simple
			`ListFragment`
			implementation.
		
		
[source,java]
----
include::res/fragmentslist/MyListFragment.java[]
----
		

		
			The next example code demonstrates the usage of a
			`ListActivity`
			.

	<section id="listactivity_layout">
=== ListActivity and custom layout
		
			You can use a custom layout with
			`ListActivity`
			or
			`ListFragment`
			. In this case the fragment or activity searches in the provided
			layout for a
			`ListView`
			with the pre-defined
			`android:id`
			attribute set to
			`@android:id/list`
			. This usage is demonstrated by the following code snippet.
		

		
[source,xml]
----
include::res/lists/listid.xml[]
----
		
		<warning>
			
				If you do not use this ID or do not include a
				`ListView`
				into your layout, the application crashes once you try to display
				the activity or the fragment.
			
		
	
	<section id="listactivity_emptyview">
=== Placeholder for an empty list
		
			You can also use a view with the
			`@android:id/empty`
			ID in your layout. The corresponding activity and fragment shows this
			view automatically if the
			`ListView`
			is empty and hides it otherwise.
			For example, you could
			display
			an
			error message
			in such
			a view.
