== Additional Open Source libraries
	
		Sometimes having to press a refresh button on the ActionBar to
		refresh
		data can be annoying for the user. Chris Banes has implemented
		an Open
		Source
		library to implement the pull to refresh
		pattern for a
		`Listview`
		. https://github.com/chrisbanes/Android-PullToRefresh.
	
	
		Also you may want to use the swipe to dismiss gesture to delete
		items
		from a ListView. Roman Nurik provides an example for this at
		https://github.com/romannurik/android-swipetodismiss[Android swipe-to-dismiss library]
		which
		Jake Wharton backported to earlier Android releases at
		https://github.com/JakeWharton/SwipeToDismissNOA[SwipeToDismissNOA].
